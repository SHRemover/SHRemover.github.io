    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s StoneChapter Ten Halloween 第十章 万圣节 Malfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection. 马尔福不敢相信自己的眼睛，第二天他看到哈利和罗恩还在霍格沃茨，虽然看上去很累，但非常高兴。的确，到了第二天早上，哈利和罗恩觉得见到这只三头狗是一次极好的冒险，他们非常想再来一次。与此同时，哈利把包裹从古灵阁搬到霍格沃茨的事告诉了罗恩，他们花了很多时间想知道，什么东西可能需要这么重的保护。 “It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron. “它要么非常值钱，要么非常危险，”罗恩说。 “Or both,” said Harry. “或者两者都有。” But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues. 但是，由于他们所知道的关于这个神秘物体的全部确切信息是它大约有两英寸长，如果没有进一步的线索，他们猜不出它是什么东西的可能性不大。 Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again. 纳威和赫敏对藏在狗和活板门下面的东西都不感兴趣。纳威只关心再也不要靠近那条狗。 Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later. 赫敏现在拒绝跟哈利和罗恩说话，但她是一个专横的万事通，他们把这看作是额外的奖励。他们现在真正想要的是找到一种报复马尔福的方法。令他们大为高兴的是，大约一个星期后，他们收到了一封邮件。 As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone’s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel. 当猫头鹰像往常一样涌进大厅时，大家的注意力立刻被六只大尖猫头鹰提着的又长又细的包裹吸引住了。哈利和其他人一样，对这个大包里装的是什么东西很感兴趣。当猫头鹰飞下来，把它落在他面前，把他的熏肉撞倒在地时，哈利感到很吃惊。他们还没来得及闪开，另一只猫头鹰就把一封信落在了包裹上。 Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: 哈利先撕开信，这很幸运，因为信上写着: DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. 不要在餐桌上打开包裹。 It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don’t want everybody knowing you’ve got a broomstick or they’ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first training session. 这里边装的是你的新扫帚”光轮2000”，但我不想让每个人都知道你有飞天扫帚，否则他们都想要一把。奥利弗·伍德今晚7点在魁地奇球场和你碰面，开始你的第一次训练。 Professor McGonagall 麦格教授 Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read. 哈利把纸条递给罗恩看时，难以掩饰自己的喜悦。 “A Nimbus Two Thousand!” Ron moaned enviously. “I’ve never even touched one.” “光轮2000 !”罗恩羡慕地呻吟着。“我从没碰过。” They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it. 他们很快地离开了大厅，想在第一节课开始前单独打开扫帚，但在门厅的半路上，他们发现楼上被克拉布和高尔挡住了去路。马尔福从哈利手里接过包裹，摸了摸。 “That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. “You’ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren’t allowed them.” “那是把扫帚。”他说着把扫帚扔还给哈利，脸上混杂着嫉妒和怨恨。“这回你可要倒霉了，波特，一年级是不允许的。” Ron couldn’t resist it. 罗恩实在忍不住了。 “It’s not any old broomstick,” he said, “it’s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you’ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?” Ron grinned at Harry. “Comets look flashy, but they’re not in the same league as the Nimbus.” “这不是什么旧扫帚，”他说，“这是‘光轮2000’。”你说你家里有什么，马尔福，260彗星?罗恩冲哈利咧嘴一笑。”慧星’看起来也挺华丽的，可它们和’灵光’一比，哼，根本不是同一等级的嘛。 “What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn’t afford half the handle,” Malfoy snapped back. “I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.” “你懂什么！威斯里，你恐怕连这个扫帚头都没有吧,”“我想你和你的兄弟们得一根一根地攒起来。” Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy’s elbow. 罗恩还没来得及回答，弗立维教授就出现在马尔福身边。 “Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked. “我希望你们不要争论，孩子们?””他发出“吱吱”的响声。 “Potter’s been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said Malfoy quickly. “教授，波特被送来了一把扫帚。”马尔福急忙说。 “Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. “Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?” “是的，是的，说得对，”弗立维教授对哈利笑着说。“麦格教授把特殊情况都告诉了我，波特。它是什么模型?” “A Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,” said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face. “And it’s really thanks to Malfoy here that I’ve got it,” he added. “是‘光轮2000’。”“多亏了马尔福，我才得到了它。” Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy’s obvious rage and confusion. 哈利和罗恩朝楼上走去，对马尔福明显的愤怒和困惑忍住了笑声。 “Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, “If he hadn’t stolen Neville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team⋯” “嗯,这是真的,”哈利乐不可支,因为他们达到大理石楼梯的顶端,“如果他没有偷了内维尔的记忆球,我也不会在球队⋯” “So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking rules?” came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand. “所以我想你认为这是对违反规定的奖励?”一个愤怒的声音从他们身后传来。赫敏跺着脚上了楼梯，不满地看着哈利手里的包裹。 “I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry. “我还以为你不和我们说话呢?””哈利说。 “Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good.” “是的，别停，”罗恩说，“这对我们太好了。” Hermione marched away with her nose in the air. 赫敏昂首阔步地走开了。 Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he’d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last. 那天，哈利费了好大劲才把注意力集中在功课上。它不停地跑到他的新扫帚放在床底下的宿舍，或者跑到他那天晚上要学打魁地奇球的场地。那天晚上，他狼吞虎咽地吃了一顿晚饭，根本没注意自己在吃什么，然后和罗恩一起冲上楼，终于打开了“光轮2000”。 “Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bedspread. “哇，”罗恩叹了口气，扫帚滚到了哈利的床单上。 Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top. 就连对这些不同的扫帚一无所知的哈利也觉得它们看起来棒极了。它光滑而闪亮，有一个桃花心木把手，有一条长长的尾巴，尾巴上整齐笔直地插着细枝，顶部用金色写着“光轮2000”。 As seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high. 七点钟越来越近了，哈利离开城堡，在暮色中向魁地奇球场走去。以前从未在体育场举行过。球场周围的看台上竖起了数百个座位，这样观众就能看到发生了什么事。在田野的两头各有三根金色的杆子，杆子的一头有铁箍。它们使哈利想起了麻瓜孩子们吹肥皂泡用的塑料小棍，只是它们有五十英尺高。 Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch. 哈利迫不及待地想再飞起来，等不到伍德。他骑上扫帚，从地上踢了起来。这是一种多么美妙的感觉啊——他突然从球门冲了进来，又冲了出来，然后在球场上又跑上跑下。光轮2000只要他轻轻一碰，就会转到他想去的地方。 “Hey, Potter, come down!” “嘿，波特，下来!” Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him. 奥利弗·伍德已经到了。他腋下夹着一只大木箱。哈利在他旁边着陆。 “Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what McGonagall meant⋯ you really are a natural. I’m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.” “很好，”伍德说，他的眼睛闪闪发光。“我看到麦格是什么意思⋯你真是个自然。今天晚上我来教你们规则，然后你就可以每周参加三次小组练习了。” He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls. 他打开板条箱。里面有四个大小不同的球。 “Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it’s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.” “没错,”伍德说。“现在，魁地奇很容易理解，即使它不太容易玩。双方各有七名队员。其中三个被称为追球者。 “Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. “三个追球手。”哈利重复道，伍德拿出一个足球大小的大红球。 “This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Wood. “The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?” “这个球叫鬼飞球，”伍德说。追球手们把鬼飞球扔给对方，然后试着让它穿过其中一个球门，进一球。每次鬼飞球经过一个篮圈就得10分。跟我来?” “The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,” Harry recited. “So — that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t it?” “追球手把鬼飞球扔出去，穿过球门得分。”哈利背诵道。“所以——这有点像骑着扫帚打篮球，带着六个篮筐，不是吗?” “What’s basketball?” said Wood curiously. “篮球是什么?伍德好奇地说。 “Never mind,” said Harry quickly. “没关系，”哈利急忙说。 “Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called the Keeper — I’m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.” “现在，双方各有一名球员叫守门员——我是格兰芬多队的守门员。我得绕着我们的球门飞，阻止对方得分。” “Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. “And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?” He pointed at the three balls left inside the box. “三个追球手，一个守门员。”哈利说，他决心把这一切都记住。他们和鬼飞球一起玩。好的,明白了。那么它们是干什么用的呢?他指着盒子里剩下的三个球。 “I’ll show you now,” said Wood. “Take this.” “我现在给你看，”伍德说。“这个。” He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat. 他递给哈利一支有点像短棒球棒的小棒子。 “I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood said. “These two are the Bludgers.” “我来告诉你游走球是干什么的，”伍德说。“这两个是游走球。” He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box. 他给哈利看了两个一模一样的球，乌黑发亮，比红色的鬼飞球略小。哈利注意到它们似乎在拼命挣脱盒子里的皮带。 “Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers. “往后站。”伍德警告哈利。他弯下腰，放开了其中一只游走球。 At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry’s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground. 黑球立刻升到空中，然后径直朝哈利的脸砸去。哈利用球棒朝它挥去，不让它打断他的鼻子，然后让它曲折地飞向空中——它在他们的头上盘旋，然后向伍德开枪，伍德扑到球棒上，设法把球钉在地上。 “See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. “The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So — think you’ve got all that?” “看到了吗?伍德气喘吁吁地说，把挣扎着的游走球推回到板条箱里，用带子把它捆好。游走球飞来飞去，试图把球员们从扫帚上撞下来。这就是为什么每个队都有两个击球手——韦斯莱双胞胎是我们的——他们的工作就是保护自己的球队不被游走球击中，然后把他们撞向另一个队。那么——你认为你已经具备了所有这些条件吗?” “Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,” Harry reeled off. “三个追球手试图用鬼飞球得分;守门员看守球门柱;击球手使游走球远离他们的队伍。 “Very good,” said Wood. “很好，”伍德说。 “Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand. “呃——游走球杀过人吗?”哈利问，希望他的话听起来很随便。 “Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That’s you. And you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers—” “在霍格瓦彻学校里还没发生过这种事。我们有过几次下巴骨折，但没有比这更糟糕的了。现在，最后一个队员是探索者。这是你的。你不用担心鬼飞球和游走球 “— unless they crack my head open.” “除非他们把我的头敲开。” “Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.” “别担心，韦斯莱兄弟比游走球强多了——我是说，他们自己就像一对游走球。” Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings. 伍德把手伸进板条箱，拿出了第四个也是最后一个球。与鬼飞球和游走球相比，它很小，大约有一个大核桃那么大。它是明亮的金色，有银色的小翅膀。 “This,” said Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the most important ball of the lot. It’s very hard to catch because it’s so fast and difficult to see. It’s the Seeker’s job to catch it. You’ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages — I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep. “这个，”伍德说，“是金色飞贼，它是所有球中最重要的一个。它非常难接住，因为它跑得太快，很难看清。”探索者的工作就是抓住它。你必须在追球手、击球手、游走球和鬼飞球之间来回穿梭，才能在对方的找球手之前拿到球，因为无论哪位找球手抓到金色飞贼，他的球队就能多得150分，所以他们几乎总是赢。这也是为什么要找到一个优秀的搜索者会那么困难。一场魁地奇比赛只有在金色飞贼被抓住的时候才会结束，所以这种情况可能会持续很长时间——我想纪录是三个月，他们不得不不停地换上替补，这样球员们才能睡一会儿。 “Well, that’s it, any questions?” “好了，就这些了，有什么问题吗?” Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem. 哈利摇摇头。他明白他必须做什么好吧，这就是问题所在。 “We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, “it’s too dark, we might lose it. Let’s try you out with a few of these.” “我们还不打算和金色飞贼一起训练，”伍德说着，小心翼翼地把它关进板条箱里，“天太黑了，我们可能会把它弄丢的。”让我们用其中的一些来试试你。” He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch. 他从口袋里掏出一袋普通的高尔夫球，几分钟后，他和哈利飞到了空中，伍德用尽全力朝各个方向扔高尔夫球，让哈利接住。 Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn’t carry on. 哈利一个也没错过，伍德很高兴。半小时后，天真的黑了，他们无法继续了。 “That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.” “今年魁地奇杯上要刻上我们的名字了。”他们步履蹒跚地回到城堡，伍德高兴地说。“如果你比查理·韦斯莱表现得更好，我不会感到惊讶。如果他没有去追龙的话，他本来可以为英格兰队效力的。” Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics. 也许是因为他现在太忙了，每周有三个晚上在做作业的同时还要练习魁地奇，但是当哈利意识到他已经在霍格沃茨两个月了，他简直不敢相信。这座城堡比女贞路更像一个家。他的课也变得越来越有趣，因为他们已经掌握了基础知识。 On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they’d seen him make Neville’s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day Harry’s broomstick had arrived. 万圣节的早晨，他们醒来时，走廊里飘着烤南瓜的香味。更妙的是，弗立维教授在符咒课上宣布，他认为他们已经准备好让物体飞起来了。自从他们看到他让纳威的癞蛤蟆在教室里飞来飞去以来，他们一直非常想试一试。弗立维教授把全班分成两组进行练习。哈利的搭档是西莫·芬尼根(这让他松了一口气，因为纳威一直试图吸引他的目光)。然而，罗恩要和赫敏·格兰杰一起工作。很难说罗恩和赫敏对此更生气了。自从哈利的飞天扫帚到达的那天起，她就没有和他们说过话。 “Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve been practicing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. “Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too — never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s’ instead of ‘f’ and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.” “现在，别忘了我们一直在练习的那个漂亮的手腕动作!”弗立维教授像往常一样坐在那堆书的上面，尖声叫道。“Swish and flick，记住，Swish and flick。”而且正确地念咒语也非常重要——永远不要忘记巫师巴鲁菲奥，他说的是“s”而不是“f”，结果发现自己躺在地板上，胸前放着一头水牛。 It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it — Harry had to put it out with his hat. 这是非常困难的。哈利和西莫嗖嗖地拍打着，但他们本应该飞向天空的羽毛却落在了桌面上。西莫等得不耐烦了，他用魔杖捅了捅，放火烧了它——哈利只好用帽子把它扑灭了。 Ron, at the next table, wasn’t having much more luck. 坐在旁边桌子上的罗恩运气也好不到哪里去。 “Wingardium Leviosa!” he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill. “维加的地登拉维泥沙！他喊道，像风车一样挥动着他的长胳膊。 “You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. “It’s Wing- gar -dium Levi- o -sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and long.” “你说错了。”哈利听见赫敏厉声说。“应该是维加地登拉维提沙！念’加’字时要拉长一点，别太快。” “You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled. “那么，如果你这么聪明，你就去做吧。” Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, “Wingardium Leviosa!” 赫敏卷起长袍的袖子，挥动魔杖，说:“维加的地登拉维泥沙！” Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads. 他们的羽毛从桌子上掉了下来，在头顶上方四英尺处盘旋。 “Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. “Everyone see here, Miss Granger’s done it!” “哦,做得好!弗立维教授鼓掌喊道。“大家都看到了，格兰杰小姐做到了!” Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. 到下课的时候，罗恩的心情很不好。 “It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.” “难怪没人能忍受她，”当他们挤进拥挤的走廊时，他对哈利说，“说实话，她是个噩梦。” Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face — and was startled to see that she was in tears. 当他们匆匆经过哈利身边时，有人撞了他。这是赫敏。哈利瞥了她一眼，吃惊地发现她在哭。 “I think she heard you.” “我想她听到了。” “So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. “She must’ve noticed she’s got no friends.” “所以呢?罗恩说，但他看上去有点不舒服。“她一定注意到她没有朋友。” Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds. 赫敏下节课没来，整个下午都没人看见。在去礼堂参加万圣节宴会的路上，哈利和罗恩无意中听到帕瓦蒂·帕蒂尔对她的朋友拉文德说，赫敏在女厕所里哭，想一个人呆着。罗恩听了这话显得更加尴尬，但过了一会儿，他们走进了大厅，那里的万圣节装饰把赫敏从他们的脑海中抹去了。 A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet. 上千只活蝙蝠从墙上和天花板上飞下来，还有上千只在低矮的乌云中从桌子上俯冲下来，使得南瓜上的蜡烛摇曳不定。宴会突然出现在金盘子上，就像开学宴会上一样。 Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.” 哈利正要吃烤土豆，奇洛教授急匆匆地跑进大厅，他的头巾歪了，脸上露出恐惧的神色。当他走到邓布利多教授的椅子前，瘫倒在桌子上，喘着气说:“巨魔——在地牢里——以为你应该知道。” He then sank to the floor in a dead faint. 然后他昏倒在地。 There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore’s wand to bring silence. 当时一片哗然。邓布利多教授的魔杖头发出了几声紫色的鞭炮，沉寂了下来。 “Prefects,” he rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!” “班长们，”他咕哝着说，“马上带领本班同学回到自己的宿舍去！” Percy was in his element. 珀西得心应手。 “Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I’m a prefect!” “跟我来!在一起，第一年!如果你听从我的命令，就没有必要害怕巨魔!现在跟在我后面。让开，第一年即将到来!对不起，我是级长!” “How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as they climbed the stairs. “巨魔怎么可能进来?”他们爬楼梯时，哈利问。 “Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,” said Ron. “Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.” “别问我，他们应该真的很笨，”罗恩说。“也许皮皮鬼把它当成了万圣节的玩笑。” They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron’s arm. 他们经过了不同的人群，朝不同的方向匆匆而过。当他们挤过一群不知所措的赫奇帕奇学生时，哈利突然抓住罗恩的胳膊。 “I’ve just thought — Hermione.” “我刚想——赫敏。” “What about her?” “她怎么样?” “She doesn’t know about the troll.” “她不知道巨魔的事。” Ron bit his lip. 罗恩咬着嘴唇。 “Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Percy’d better not see us.” “哦，好吧，”他厉声说。“不过得注意点，别让伯希发现我们溜走。” Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls’ bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them. 他们蹲下身子，和赫奇帕奇的学生们一起向相反的方向走去，溜下一条空无一人的走廊，匆匆向女生洗手间走去。他们刚转过街角，就听到身后有急促的脚步声。 “Percy!” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin. “珀西!罗恩嘶嘶叫着，把哈利拖到一只巨大的石狮鹫后面。 Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view. 然而，他们环顾四周，看到的不是珀西，而是斯内普。他穿过走廊，从视野中消失了。 “What’s he doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn’t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?” “他在做什么?”哈利低声说。“他为什么不和其他老师一起下到地牢里去呢?” “Search me.” “跟着他。” Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape’s fading footsteps. 他们尽可能安静地沿着下一条走廊蹑手蹑脚地走着，斯内普的脚步声渐渐远去。 “He’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Ron held up his hand. “他要去三楼。”哈利说，但罗恩举起了手。 “Can you smell something?” “你闻到什么了吗?” Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean. 哈利闻了闻，一股恶臭扑鼻而来，混杂着旧袜子和一种似乎没人打扫的公共厕所。 And then they heard it — a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed — at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. 然后他们听到了——一种低沉的咕噜声，还有巨大的脚步声。罗恩指了指——在左边走廊的尽头，有个庞然大物朝他们走来。他们躲进阴影里，看着它出现在一片月光下。 It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long. 那是可怕的景象。它有十二英尺高，皮肤暗沉，像花岗石一样灰色，硕大的身躯像一块巨石，小小的光头像椰子一样顶在上面。它的腿很短，像树干一样粗，脚又平又角质。它散发出的气味令人难以置信。它拿着一根巨大的木棍，由于它的胳膊很长，木棍在地上拖着。 The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room. 巨魔在门口停了下来，向里面张望。它摇着长长的耳朵，下定决心，然后懒洋洋地慢慢走进房间。 “The keys in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could lock it in.” “钥匙在锁里。”哈利低声说，“我们可以把它锁起来。” “Good idea,” said Ron nervously. “好主意。”罗恩紧张地说。 They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn’t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it. 他们侧着身子朝开着的门走去，口干舌燥，祈祷巨魔不要出来。哈利一跃而起，抓起钥匙，砰地一声关上门，锁上了。 “Yes!” “是的!” Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop — a high, petrified scream — and it was coming from the chamber they’d just chained up. 他们胜利了，脸涨得通红，开始往回跑，但当他们跑到拐角处时，他们听到一种使他们的心都停止跳动的声音——一种高而僵硬的尖叫——是从他们刚刚用铁链锁住的房间里传出来的。 “Oh, no,” said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron. “哦，不，”罗恩说，脸色苍白得像带血的男爵。 “It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped. “这是女生洗手间!””哈利喘着粗气。 “Hermione!” they said together. “赫敏!他们一起说。 It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside. 这是他们最不愿意做的事，但是他们有什么选择呢?他们转过身，飞快地跑回门口，转动钥匙，惊慌失措地摸索着。哈利把门拉开，他们跑了进去。 Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went. 赫敏·格兰杰缩在对面的墙上，看上去好像要晕倒了。巨魔朝她走来，一边走一边把水槽从墙上撞下来。 “Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall. “拖住它! 哈利绝望地对罗恩说，抓起一个水龙头，使劲往墙上一扔。 The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went. 巨魔在离赫敏几英尺远的地方停住了。它笨拙地走来走去，傻里傻气地眨着眼睛，想看看是什么发出了响声。它那卑鄙的小眼睛看见了哈利。它犹豫了一下，然后转向他，一边走一边举起棍子。 “Oy, pea-brain!” yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn’t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it. “嘿，你这猪脑袋! 罗恩从房间的另一头喊道，朝它扔了一根金属管。巨魔似乎没有注意到烟斗打中了它的肩膀，但它听到了尖叫声，又停了下来，把它丑陋的鼻子转向罗恩，让哈利有时间绕着它跑。 “Come on, run, run!” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn’t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror. “快点，快跑，快跑!”哈利对赫敏喊道，想把她拉到门口，可是她动也动不了，她仍然紧贴着墙，吓得张大了嘴巴。 The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape. 喊声和回声似乎把巨魔逼疯了。它又吼了一声，朝罗恩走去，罗恩离它最近，也没有办法逃跑。 Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll’s neck from behind. The troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry’s wand had still been in his hand when he’d jumped - it had gone straight up one of the troll’s nostrils. 然后，哈利做了一件既勇敢又愚蠢的事:他飞快地跑了一圈，设法从后面抱住巨怪的脖子。巨魔感觉不到哈利挂在那里，但即使是巨魔也会注意到，如果你把一根长木头插进它的鼻子，当它跳起来的时候，哈利的魔杖还在它手里——它径直插进了巨魔的一个鼻孔。 Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club. 巨魔痛苦地嚎叫着，扭动着棍棒，哈利死命抓住不放;任何一秒钟，巨魔都有可能把他撕成碎片，或者用棍子狠狠地揍他一顿。 Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand — not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: “Wingardium Leviosa!” 赫敏吓得瘫在地上;罗恩拔出自己的魔杖——他不知道该怎么办，只听见自己喊出了脑子里第一个咒语:“羽加迪姆勒维奥萨!” The club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner’s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble. 棍子突然从巨魔的手中飞了出来，飞得很高，很高，一直升到空中，慢慢地翻了个身，啪的一声落到它主人的头上。巨魔当场摇晃了一下，然后脸朝下倒了下去，砰的一声，整个房间都颤抖起来。 Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done. 哈利站了起来。他浑身发抖，上气不接下气。罗恩站在那里，魔杖还举着，盯着自己的所作所为。 It was Hermione who spoke first. 是赫敏先开口的。 “Is it — dead?” “它死了吗?” “I don’t think so,” said Harry, I think it’s just been knocked out.” “我不这么认为，”哈利说，“我想它只是被撞昏了。” He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue. 他弯下腰，从巨魔的鼻子里拔出魔杖。它被一种看起来像粗糙的灰色胶水的东西覆盖着。 “Urgh — troll boogers.” “呃——巨魔鼻屎 He wiped it on the troll’s trousers. 他在巨怪的裤子上擦了擦。 A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn’t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll’s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. 一阵突然的摔门声和响亮的脚步声使他们三人抬起头来。他们没有意识到自己发出了多么响亮的声音，但当然，楼下一定有人听到了碰撞声和巨魔的怒吼。过了一会儿，麦格教授冲进屋来，后面紧跟着斯内普，奇洛走在后面。奇洛看了一眼巨怪，发出一声微弱的呜咽，然后迅速地坐在马桶上，紧紧抓住他的心。 Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s mind. 斯内普俯身向着巨魔。麦格教授看着罗恩和哈利。哈利从没见过她这么生气过。她的嘴唇发白。格兰芬多赢得50分的希望很快从哈利的脑海中消失了。 “What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t you in your dormitory?” “你到底在想什么?”麦格教授冷冷地、愤怒地说。哈利看着罗恩，他还站在那里，魔杖举在空中。“你没死真是幸运。”你为什么不在宿舍?” Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down. 斯内普迅速而锐利地看了哈利一眼。哈利看着地板。他希望罗恩能放下魔杖。 Then a small voice came out of the shadows. 然后一个细小的声音从阴影中传来。 “Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.” “麦康娜教授，他们在找我。” “Miss Granger!” “格兰杰小姐!” Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last. 赫敏终于站了起来。 “I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I could deal with it on my own — you know, because I’ve read all about them.” “我去找巨魔，因为我——我想我可以自己对付它——你知道，因为我读过关于它们的一切。” Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher? 罗恩扔掉了魔杖。赫敏格兰杰，对老师撒了个弥天大谎? “If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn’t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.” “如果他们没有找到我，我现在就死了。”哈利把魔杖插进它的鼻子，罗恩用棍子把它打昏了。他们没有时间来接任何人。他们来的时候，我快要完蛋了。 Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn’t new to them. 哈利和罗恩竭力装出一副对这个故事并不陌生的样子。 “Well — in that case⋯ ” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” “嗯——在这种情况下⋯”麦格教授说,盯着三人,“格兰杰小姐,你愚蠢的女孩,你怎么能认为自己解决一个山怪吗?” Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets. 赫敏低下头。哈里是说不出话来。赫敏是最不可能违犯校规的人，而她却假装违犯了校规，让他们摆脱了麻烦。斯内普好像已经开始分发糖果了。 “Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,” said Professor McGonagall. “I’m very disappointed in you. If you’re not hurt at all, you’d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses.” “格兰杰小姐，为此格兰芬多要扣掉五分。”麦格教授说。“我对你很失望。如果你没有受伤，你最好去格兰芬多塔。学生们正在他们的家里吃大餐。 Hermione left. 赫敏离开了。 Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron. 麦格教授转向哈利和罗恩。 “Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.” “好吧，我还是说你很幸运，但在最初的几年里，你不可能遇到一个成年的山怪。”你们每人为格兰芬多赢得5分。邓布利多教授会知道的。你可以走了。” They hurried out of the chamber and didn’t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else. 他们匆匆走出房间，直到上了两层楼才开口说话。远离巨魔的气味，远离其他任何东西，这是一种解脱。 “We should have gotten more than ten points,” Ron grumbled. “我们应该得10分以上。”罗恩抱怨道。 “Five, you mean, once she’s taken off Hermione’s.” “只有5分。因为赫敏被老师扣了5分。” “Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,” Ron admitted. “Mind you, we did save her.” “她真好，让我们摆脱了那样的麻烦。”“请注意，我们确实救了她。” “She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked the thing in with her,” Harry reminded him. “如果我们没有把那东西锁在她身边，她可能就不需要救了。”哈利提醒他。 They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. 他们走到胖夫人的画像跟前。 “Pig snout,” they said and entered. “猪鼻子，”他们说着走了进去。 The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said “Thanks,” and hurried off to get plates. 公共休息室里挤满了人，很吵。每个人都在吃送来的食物。然而，赫敏独自站在门口，等着他们。一阵尴尬的沉默。然后，他们谁也没有看对方一眼，都说了声“谢谢”，然后急忙去拿盘子。 But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them. 但从那一刻起，赫敏格兰杰成了他们的朋友。有些事情你不能和别人分享，但最终你们会喜欢上对方，击倒一个12英尺高的巨魔就是其中之一。 J.K.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s StoneChapter Ten HalloweenMalfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection. “It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron. “Or both,” said Harry. But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues. Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again. Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later. As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone’s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel. Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don’t want everybody knowing you’ve got a broomstick or they’ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first training session. Professor McGonagall Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read. “A Nimbus Two Thousand!” Ron moaned enviously. “I’ve never even touched one.” They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it. “That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. “You’ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren’t allowed them.” Ron couldn’t resist it. “It’s not any old broomstick,” he said, “it’s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you’ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?” Ron grinned at Harry. “Comets look flashy, but they’re not in the same league as the Nimbus.” “What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn’t afford half the handle,” Malfoy snapped back. “I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.” Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy’s elbow. “Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked. “Potter’s been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said Malfoy quickly. “Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. “Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?” “A Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,” said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face. “And it’s really thanks to Malfoy here that I’ve got it,” he added. Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy’s obvious rage and confusion. “Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, “If he hadn’t stolen Neville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team⋯” “So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking rules?” came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand. “I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry. “Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good.” Hermione marched away with her nose in the air. Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he’d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last. “Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bedspread. Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top. As seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high. Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch. “Hey, Potter, come down!” Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him. “Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what McGonagall meant⋯ you really are a natural. I’m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.” He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls. “Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it’s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.” “Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. “This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Wood. “The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?” “The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,” Harry recited. “So — that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t it?” “What’s basketball?” said Wood curiously. “Never mind,” said Harry quickly. “Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called the Keeper — I’m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.” “Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. “And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?” He pointed at the three balls left inside the box. “I’ll show you now,” said Wood. “Take this.” He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat. “I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood said. “These two are the Bludgers.” He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box. “Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers. At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry’s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground. “See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. “The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So — think you’ve got all that?” “Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,” Harry reeled off. “Very good,” said Wood. “Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand. “Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That’s you. And you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers—” “— unless they crack my head open.” “Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.” Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings. “This,” said Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the most important ball of the lot. It’s very hard to catch because it’s so fast and difficult to see. It’s the Seeker’s job to catch it. You’ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages — I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep. “Well, that’s it, any questions?” Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem. “We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, “it’s too dark, we might lose it. Let’s try you out with a few of these.” He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch. Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn’t carry on. “That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.” Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics. On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they’d seen him make Neville’s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day Harry’s broomstick had arrived. “Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve been practicing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. “Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too — never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s’ instead of ‘f’ and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.” It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it — Harry had to put it out with his hat. Ron, at the next table, wasn’t having much more luck. “Wingardium Leviosa!” he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill. “You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. “It’s Wing- gar -dium Levi- o -sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and long.” “You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled. Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, “Wingardium Leviosa!” Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads. “Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. “Everyone see here, Miss Granger’s done it!” Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. “It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.” Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face — and was startled to see that she was in tears. “I think she heard you.” “So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. “She must’ve noticed she’s got no friends.” Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds. A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet. Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.” He then sank to the floor in a dead faint. There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore’s wand to bring silence. “Prefects,” he rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!” Percy was in his element. “Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I’m a prefect!” “How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as they climbed the stairs. “Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,” said Ron. “Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.” They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron’s arm. “I’ve just thought — Hermione.” “What about her?” “She doesn’t know about the troll.” Ron bit his lip. “Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Percy’d better not see us.” Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls’ bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them. “Percy!” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin. Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view. “What’s he doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn’t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?” “Search me.” Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape’s fading footsteps. “He’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Ron held up his hand. “Can you smell something?” Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean. And then they heard it — a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed — at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long. The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room. “The keys in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could lock it in.” “Good idea,” said Ron nervously. They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn’t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it. “Yes!” Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop — a high, petrified scream — and it was coming from the chamber they’d just chained up. “Oh, no,” said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron. “It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped. “Hermione!” they said together. It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside. Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went. “Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall. The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went. “Oy, pea-brain!” yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn’t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it. “Come on, run, run!” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn’t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror. The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape. Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll’s neck from behind. The troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry’s wand had still been in his hand when he’d jumped - it had gone straight up one of the troll’s nostrils. Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club. Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand — not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: “Wingardium Leviosa!” The club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner’s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble. Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done. It was Hermione who spoke first. “Is it — dead?” “I don’t think so,” said Harry, I think it’s just been knocked out.” He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue. “Urgh — troll boogers.” He wiped it on the troll’s trousers. A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn’t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll’s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s mind. “What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t you in your dormitory?” Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down. Then a small voice came out of the shadows. “Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.” “Miss Granger!” Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last. “I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I could deal with it on my own — you know, because I’ve read all about them.” Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher? “If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn’t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.” Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn’t new to them. “Well — in that case⋯ ” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets. “Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,” said Professor McGonagall. “I’m very disappointed in you. If you’re not hurt at all, you’d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses.” Hermione left. Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron. “Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.” They hurried out of the chamber and didn’t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else. “We should have gotten more than ten points,” Ron grumbled. “Five, you mean, once she’s taken off Hermione’s.” “Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,” Ron admitted. “Mind you, we did save her.” “She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked the thing in with her,” Harry reminded him. They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. “Pig snout,” they said and entered. The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said “Thanks,” and hurried off to get plates. But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s StoneChapter Nine The Midnight Duel 第九章 午夜的决斗 Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn’t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday — and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together. 哈利从没想过他会遇到一个比达力更讨厌的男孩，但那是在他遇见德拉科马尔福之前。尽管如此，格兰芬多一年级的学生只有斯莱特林的魔药课，所以他们不太需要忍受马尔福。至少，直到他们发现格兰芬多公共休息室里贴着一张告示，吓得他们呻吟起来，他们才明白过来。飞行课将在周四开始，格兰芬多和斯莱特林将一起学习。 “Typical,” said Harry darkly. “Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.” “典型。”哈利阴郁地说。这正是我一直想要的。在马尔福面前骑着扫帚把出丑。 He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else. 他一直盼望着学习飞行，这比什么都重要。 “You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” said Ron reasonably. “Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that’s all talk.” “你不知道你会出丑的，”罗恩理智地说。“不管怎么说，我知道马尔福总是吹嘘他的魁地奇有多好，但我敢打赌那都是空话。” Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn’t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he’d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who’d listen about the time he’d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie’s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn’t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move. 马尔福确实经常谈论飞行。他大声抱怨一年级的时候从来没有进过学院魁地奇队，还没完没了地讲一些自吹自擂的故事。然而，他并不是唯一一个这样做的人:按照谢默斯·芬尼根(Seamus Finnigan)的说法，他童年的大部分时间都是骑着扫帚在乡间飞驰。即使是罗恩也会告诉任何愿意听的人，有一次他差点撞上查理旧扫帚上的悬挂式滑翔机。每个巫师家庭的人都在不停地谈论魁地奇。罗恩已经和同宿舍的迪安·托马斯就足球问题大吵了一架。罗恩看不出只有一个球、不许任何人飞的比赛有什么好玩的。哈利发现罗恩在戳迪恩的西汉姆联队海报，想让队员们动起来。 Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she’d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground. 纳威从来没有骑过扫帚，因为他奶奶从来不让他骑。哈利私下里觉得她这么做是有道理的，因为纳威即使双脚着地，也会出很多意外。 Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn’t learn by heart out of a book — not that she hadn’t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. 赫敏格兰杰几乎和纳威一样害怕坐飞机。这是你无法从一本书中学到的东西——不是她没有尝试过。星期四吃早饭的时候，她从图书馆的《魁地奇历久记》(Quidditch Through the Ages)里弄来的飞行技巧让他们都觉得无聊。纳威紧紧抓住她说的每一个字，不顾一切地想找点什么东西来帮助他以后抓紧扫帚。可是，当赫敏的课被邮件打断时，大家都很高兴。 Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy’s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table. 自从海格的信之后，哈利再也没有收到过一封信，马尔福当然很快就注意到了这一点。马尔福的猫头鹰鹰总是从家里给他带来一包包的糖果，他得意洋洋地在斯莱特林的餐桌上打开。 A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke. 一只猫头鹰从谷仓里给纳威带来了一个小包裹。他兴奋地打开它，给他们看一个大理石球大小的玻璃球，它似乎充满了白色的烟雾。 “It’s a Remembrall!” he explained. “Gran knows I forget things — this tells you if there’s something you’ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red — oh⋯ ” His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “⋯ you’ve forgotten something⋯” “这是一个记忆球!”他解释道。“奶奶知道我忘事了——这能告诉你是不是有什么事你忘了做。”这样看,你抱紧它,如果它变红——哦⋯”他的脸就拉下来了,因为记忆球突然发出的是朱红色,“被你遗忘的⋯⋯” Neville was trying to remember what he’d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand. 当德拉科·马尔福走过格兰芬多的桌子时，纳威正努力回忆起他忘记了什么，突然从他手里夺过记忆球。 Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash. 哈利和罗恩跳了起来。他们半是希望能找个理由来对付马尔福，但麦格教授却在一瞬间出现了，她比学校里的任何老师都能更快地发现问题。 “What’s going on?” “怎么回事?” “Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.” “教授，马尔福拿走了我的记忆球。” Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table. 马尔福怒不可遏地迅速把记忆球扔回桌上。 “Just looking,” he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him. “只是看看。”他说着，斜着身子走开了，身后跟着克拉布和高尔。 At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance. 那天下午三点半，哈利、罗恩和格兰芬多的其他同学匆匆走下前面的台阶，来到操场上开始他们的第一节飞行课。这是一个晴朗的、微风习习的日子，他们沿着倾斜的草坪朝草坪对面平坦的草坪走去，草地在他们脚下荡漾着涟漪，一直走到禁林。禁林的树木在远处暗中摇曳。 The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left. 斯莱特林人已经到了，地上整整齐齐地躺着二十把扫帚。哈利听到弗雷德和乔治·韦斯莱抱怨学校的扫帚，说如果飞得太高，或者总是稍稍向左飞，有些扫帚就会震动。 Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. 他们的老师霍琦夫人来了。她有一头灰白的短发，一双鹰一般的黄眼睛。 “Well, what are you all waiting for?” she barked. “Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.” “那么，你们还在等什么呢?””她叫了起来。每个人都站在扫帚旁边。快点，快点。” Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles. 哈利低头看了看扫帚。它很旧，有些树枝以奇怪的角度伸出来。 “Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called Madam Hooch at the front, “and say ‘Up!’” “伸出你的右手在扫帚上，”前面的霍琦夫人喊道，“然后说‘起来!’” “UP” everyone shouted. ”起来“每个人都喊道。 Harry’s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger’s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville’s hadn’t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville’s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground. 哈利的扫帚立刻跳到他手里，但它是少数几个跳起来的扫帚之一。赫敏·格兰杰只是在地上打滚，纳威却一动也不动。“也许扫帚和马一样，能看出你什么时候害怕，”哈利想。纳威的声音里有一种颤抖，他说得太清楚了，他要脚踏实地。 Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he’d been doing it wrong for years. 霍琦夫人接着教他们如何骑上扫帚而不从扫帚头滑下来，并在一排排中走来走去纠正他们的握把。当她告诉马尔福他这么多年来一直在做错事时，哈利和罗恩都很高兴。 “Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,” said Madam Hooch. “Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle — three — two—” “现在，当我吹哨子的时候，你就从地上用力踢开，”霍琦夫人说。“保持你的扫帚平稳，上升几英尺，然后稍微向前倾，笔直地下来。”听到我的哨声——三——二——” But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch’s lips. 可是纳威紧张不安，害怕被留在地上，在哨子还没有吹到霍琦夫人的嘴唇上时，他就被狠狠地推开了。 “Come back, boy!” she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and — “回来,男孩!她喊道，可是纳威像一个软木塞从一个12英尺——20英尺的瓶子里弹出来一样笔直地站了起来。哈利看到他吓得脸色苍白的脸往下看，看着地上的东西掉了下来，他喘着粗气，从扫帚上侧身滑了下来 WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight. 砰——砰的一声，一声刺耳的破裂声，纳威脸朝下瘫倒在草地上。他的飞天扫帚还在越升越高，开始懒洋洋地飘向禁林，消失在视线之外。 Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his. 霍琦夫人俯身看着纳威，她的脸和他的一样苍白。 “Broken wrist,” Harry heard her mutter. “Come on, boy — it’s all right, up you get.” “手腕骨折了。”哈利听见她咕哝着。“来吧，孩子——没事的，你起来吧。” She turned to the rest of the class. 她转向全班同学。 “None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.” “我把这孩子送到医院去的时候，你们谁也不许动!”你把扫帚留在原地，否则你还来不及说“魁地奇”就得离开霍格沃茨。“来吧，亲爱的。” Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him. 纳威抓着手腕，满脸泪痕，一瘸一拐地走了，霍琦夫人搂着他。 No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter. 他们刚走到听不见的地方，马尔福就哈哈大笑起来。 “Did you see his face, the great lump?” “你看见他的脸了吗，那个大肿块?” The other Slytherins joined in. 其他斯莱特林人也加入进来。 “Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil. “闭嘴，马尔福。”帕瓦蒂·帕蒂尔厉声说道。 “Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. “Never thought you’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.” “哦，为隆巴顿挺身?”脸色铁青的斯莱特林女孩潘茜·帕金森(Pansy Parkinson)说。“从没想过你会喜欢爱哭的胖乎乎的小宝贝，帕瓦蒂。” “Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. “It’s that stupid thing Longbottom’s gran sent him.” “看!马尔福说着，飞快地向前冲去，从草地上抓了个什么东西。“是隆巴顿奶奶派来的那个蠢货。” The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up. 记忆球在阳光下闪闪发光。 “Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch. “给我，马尔福。”每个人都停下来看。 Malfoy smiled nastily. 马尔福污秽地笑了。 “I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about — up a tree?” “我想我要把它留在隆巴顿的某个地方，去找——怎么样——在树上?” “Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn’t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, “Come and get it, Potter!” “给它!哈利喊道，但马尔福已经跳上扫帚，飞走了。他没有撒谎，他能飞得很好。他悬停在一棵橡树最高的树枝上，喊道:“波特，过来拿!” Harry grabbed his broom. 哈利抓起扫帚。 “No!” shouted Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told us not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.” “不!赫敏·格兰杰喊道。“霍琦夫人叫我们不要动——你们会给我们大家带来麻烦的。” Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he’d found something he could do without being taught — this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron. 哈利忽略她。血在他的耳朵里砰砰作响。他骑上扫帚，使劲地踢着地面，飞了起来;空气穿过他的头发，长袍在他身后飘荡——一阵强烈的喜悦涌上心头，他意识到自己找到了一件不用教就能做的事——这很容易，这很美妙。他把飞天扫帚拉得高一点，想把它举得更高些，这时他听到地上女孩子们的尖叫声和喘息声，还有罗恩赞赏地叫了一声。 He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned. 他猛地转动扫帚把，在半空中面对马尔福。马尔福看着惊呆了。 “Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off that broom!” “给我，”哈利喊道，“不然我就把你从扫帚上打下来!” “Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried. “哦,是吗?马尔福说，试图冷笑，但看上去很担心。 Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping. 不知怎么的，哈利知道该怎么办。他身体前倾，双手紧紧地握着扫帚，扫帚像标枪一样向马尔福冲去。马尔福只是及时躲开了。哈利猛地一转身，稳住扫帚。下面有几个人在鼓掌。 “No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,” Harry called. “没有克拉布和高尔来救你的脖子，马尔福。” The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy. 马尔福似乎也有同样的想法。 “Catch it if you can, then!” he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground. “如果你能抓住它，那么!”他大叫着，把玻璃球抛向空中，然后飞奔回地面。 Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down — next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball — wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching — he stretched out his hand — a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist. 哈利看到球在空中上升，然后开始下落，就像慢动作一样。他身体前倾,并指出他的扫帚柄——下一秒他收集速度急剧下降,比赛球,风吹在他的耳朵里,夹杂着尖叫的人看——他伸出他的手——一只脚从地面他抓住它,及时将他的扫帚直,他温柔地推翻在草记忆球抓住安全的拳头。 “HARRY POTTER!” “哈利·波特!” His heart sank faster than he’d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling. 他的心沉得比刚才还快。麦格教授向他们跑来。他颤抖着站了起来。 “Never — in all my time at Hogwarts—” “从来没有——我在霍格沃茨的所有时间里——” Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, ” — how dare you — might have broken your neck—” 麦格教授震惊得几乎说不出话来，她的眼镜猛地一闪，“你怎么敢——差点把你的脖子摔断了——” “It wasn’t his fault, Professor—” “这不是他的错，教授——” “Be quiet, Miss Patil—” “安静点，帕蒂尔小姐——” “But Malfoy—” “但是马尔福——“ “That’s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.” “够了，韦斯莱先生。”波特，现在跟我来。” Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall’s wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he’d done it. He hadn’t even lasted two weeks. He’d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? 哈利走的时候，看见马尔福、克拉布和高尔得意洋洋的脸，他们呆呆地跟在麦格教授身后朝城堡走去。他就要被开除了，他自己就知道。他想说点什么来为自己辩护，但他的声音似乎有点不对劲。麦格教授连看都没看他一眼就走了;他得慢跑才能跟上。现在他做到了。他甚至连两周都没撑过去。他十分钟后就可以收拾行李了。当他出现在门口时，德思礼一家会怎么说呢? Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn’t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid’s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag. 走到前面的台阶上，走到里面的大理石楼梯上，麦格教授仍然一言不发。她猛地推开门，大步走在走廊上，哈利可怜巴巴地跟在她后面小跑。也许她要带他去找邓布利多。他想到了海格，他被学校开除了，但仍被允许继续当猎场看守人。也许他可以做海格的助手。他一边想象着罗恩和其他人变成巫师的情景，一边拖着海格的包在地上蹒跚而行。 Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside. 麦格教授在教室外面停了下来。她打开门，把头探了进去。 “Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?” “对不起，弗立维教授，能不能让伍德出来一会儿？” Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him? 木头？（英文中”伍德”与”木头”拼写与发音相同）”哈利有点摸不着头脑。难道麦康娜教授打算用木棒来打他一顿吗？ But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick’s class looking confused. 但伍德原来是一个人，一个从弗立维的班上走出来的魁梧的五年级男孩，神情困惑。 “Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry. “跟我来，你们两个。”麦格教授说着，他们沿着走廊往前走，伍德好奇地看着哈利。 “In here.” “在这里。” Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard. 麦格教授指给他们看一间空无一人的教室，只有皮皮鬼在忙着在黑板上写粗鲁的字。 “Out, Peeves!” she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys. “皮皮鬼，你给我出去！”她叫了起来。皮皮鬼把粉笔扔进了一个箱子里，箱子哐当一声响了起来，皮皮鬼骂骂咧咧地飞了出去。麦格教授砰地一声关上门，转身面对着两个男孩。 “Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood — I’ve found you a Seeker.” “波特，这是奥利弗·伍德。”伍德——我给你找到了一个探索者。” Wood’s expression changed from puzzlement to delight. 伍德的表情从困惑变成了喜悦。 “Are you serious, Professor?” “教授，您是认真的吗?” “Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “The boy’s a natural. I’ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?” “当然。”麦格教授干脆地说。“这个男孩是天生的。我从未见过这样的事。“波特，那是你第一次骑扫帚吗?” Harry nodded silently. He didn’t have a clue what was going on, but he didn’t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs. 哈利默默地点了点头。他不知道发生了什么，但他似乎没有被开除，一些感觉开始回到他的腿上。 “He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood. “Didn’t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn’t have done it.” 麦格教授对伍德说:“他从五十英尺的高度俯冲下来，手里抓住了那个东西。”他甚至没有抓自己。查理·韦斯莱不可能做到的。 Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once. 伍德现在看起来好像他所有的梦想一下子都实现了。 “Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked excitedly. “你看过魁地奇比赛吗，波特?”他兴奋地问。 “Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall explained. “伍德是格兰芬多队的队长。”麦格教授解释道。 “He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. “Light — speedy — we’ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.” “他简直是大生的当搜索员的材料！”伍德绕着哈利转了又转，盯着他看了又看。”身体轻盈，反应迅速……我们得给他找个合适点的扫帚才行。教授，你说哪一种合适点呢？’灵光2000’型扫帚还是’第七号清洁者’型扫帚好呢？” “I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks⋯” “我会告知丹伯多教授并和他商量一下看能不能改一下规则，让一年级的学生参加。上帝保佑，我们现在有一支比去年更强大的队伍了。自从上个比赛中我们被史林德林队打败之后，我已经有好久不敢去看史纳皮那得意洋洋的脸了……” Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry. 麦格教授透过眼镜严厉地盯着哈利。 “I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.” “我想听你说你训练得很刻苦，波特，否则我可能会改变惩罚你的主意。” Then she suddenly smiled. 然后她突然笑了。 “Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.” “你父亲会感到骄傲的，”她说。“他自己就是个出色的魁地奇球员。” “You’re joking.” “你在开玩笑吧。” It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d forgotten all about it. 这是晚餐时间。哈利刚刚告诉罗恩他和麦格教授离开教室时发生了什么事。罗恩吃了半块牛排和腰子派，但他已经完全忘记了。 “Seeker ?” he said. “But first years never — you must be the youngest house player in about—” “探索者?”“可是从没有一年级生……你将会是豪斯杯选手中最年轻的一个！有多少年没有年纪这么小的选手参赛啦？” “— a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. “Wood told me.” “——一个世纪。”哈利说着，把派塞进嘴里。下午的兴奋过后，他觉得特别饿。“是伍德告诉我的。” Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry. 罗恩很惊讶，很感动，就坐在那里目瞪口呆地看着哈利。 “I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.” “我下周开始训练，”哈利说。“只是不要告诉任何人，伍德想保守这个秘密。” Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over. 弗雷德和乔治韦斯莱走进大厅，发现了哈利，赶紧走了过去。 “Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us. We’re on the team too — Beaters.” “干得好，”乔治低声说。”伍德告诉我们。我们也在队伍里——击球手。” “I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,” said Fred. “We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.” “我告诉你，我们今年肯定会赢得魁地奇杯，”弗雷德说。“自从查理离开后，我们还没有赢过，但今年的球队将会非常出色。”你一定很乖，哈利，伍德告诉我们的时候几乎要蹦起来了。 “Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s found a new secret passageway out of the school.” “不管怎样，我们得走了，李·乔丹认为他找到了一条新的走出学校的秘密通道。” “Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.” “我敢打赌，我们第一周找到的肯定是在格列高利雕像后面的那个。再见。” Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle. 弗雷德和乔治还没走远，就出现了一个不太受欢迎的人:马尔福，他的两侧站着克拉布和高尔。 “Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?” “吃最后一顿饭吗，波特?”你什么时候搭火车回麻瓜家?” “You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and you’ve got your little friends with you,” said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl. “现在你回到地面上，带着你的小朋友们，你勇敢多了。”哈利冷冷地说。当然，关于克拉布和高尔，没有什么可说的，但是，由于高桌上坐满了老师，他们俩除了扭扭手指关节，皱起眉头之外，什么也做不了。 “I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy. “Tonight, if you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only — no contact. What’s the matter? Never heard of a wizard’s duel before, I suppose?” “我愿意在任何时候单独对付你，”马尔福说。“今晚，如果你愿意的话。”巫师的决斗。只有魔杖-没有接触。有什么事吗?我想以前从没听说过巫师决斗吧?” “Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around. “I’m his second, who’s yours?” “当然有。”罗恩说着转过身来。“我是他的副手，谁是你的?” Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up. 马尔福看着克拉布和高尔，打量着他们。 “Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? We’ll meet you in the trophy room; that’s always unlocked.” “克拉布,”他说。“午夜好吗?我们在奖杯陈列室等你;这是一直开着的。” When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. 马尔福走后，罗恩和哈利面面相觑。 “What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry. “And what do you mean, you’re my second?” “巫师的决斗是什么?””哈利说。“你是什么意思，你是我的副手?” “Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry’s face, he added quickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.” “好吧，如果你死了，还有一秒钟的时间来接替你。”罗恩漫不经心地说，最后开始吃他的冷馅饼。看到哈利脸上的表情，他迅速补充道:“但人们只有在真正的巫师决斗中才会死去。你和马尔福最多只能互相擦出火花。你们俩都不懂魔法，不会造成真正的伤害。我敢打赌，不管怎样，他希望你拒绝。” “And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?” “如果我挥动魔杖，什么也没发生怎么办?” “Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron suggested. “把它扔掉，打他的鼻子。”罗恩建议. “Excuse me.” “对不起。” They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger. 他们都抬起头来。是赫敏格兰杰。 “Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron. “在这地方不能安安静静地吃饭吗?””罗恩说。 Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry. 赫敏不理他，跟哈利说话。 “I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying—” “我无意中听到你和马尔福在说什么——” “Bet you could,” Ron muttered. “真希望你没有听到。”罗恩低声响咕。 “— and you mustn’t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if you’re caught, and you’re bound to be. It’s really very selfish of you.” ——你千万不要晚上在学校里闲逛，想想如果你被抓住，你会失去多少分，这是肯定的。你真是太自私了。” “And it’s really none of your business,” said Harry. “这真的不关你的事，”哈利说。 “Good-bye,” said Ron. “再见,”罗恩说道。 All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn’t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as “If he tries to curse you, you’d better dodge it, because I can’t remember how to block them.” There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness — this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn’t miss it. 尽管如此，这并不是你所说的一天的完美结束，哈利想。过了很久，他醒着躺在床上，听着迪安和西莫睡着了(纳威没有从医院回来)。罗恩整个晚上都在给他出主意，比如“如果他想诅咒你，你最好躲开，因为我不记得该怎么阻止他们。”“他们很有可能会被费尔奇或诺里斯太太逮个正着。哈利觉得自己太得寸进尺了，今天又违反了一条校规。”另一方面，马尔福那张冷笑的脸在黑暗中不断浮现——这是他面对面打败马尔福的大好机会。他不会错过的。 “Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better go.” “十一点半，”罗恩说，“我们最好走了。” They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, “I can’t believe you’re going to do this, Harry.” 他们穿上浴衣，拿起魔杖，蹑手蹑脚地穿过塔楼房间，走下螺旋形楼梯，进了格兰芬多公共休息室。壁炉里还有余烬在燃烧，把所有的扶手椅都变成了弯弯曲曲的黑影。他们快到肖像洞口时，离他们最近的椅子上传来一个声音:“我不敢相信你会这么做，哈利。” A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown. 灯忽明忽暗地亮着。那是赫敏·格兰杰，穿着粉红色的浴衣，皱着眉头。 “You!” said Ron furiously. “Go back to bed!” “你!罗恩愤怒地说。“回去睡觉!” “I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, “Percy — he’s a prefect, he’d put a stop to this.” “我差点告诉你哥哥，”赫敏厉声说道，“珀西——他是级长，他会阻止这件事的。” Harry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering. 哈利不敢相信有人会这么多管闲事。 “Come on,” he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole. “来吧，”他对罗恩说。他推开胖夫人的画像，从洞里爬了进去。 Hermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose. 赫敏不会轻易放弃的。她跟着罗恩穿过肖像洞，像只愤怒的鹅一样对他们发出嘶嘶声。 “Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don’t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.” “你不关心格兰芬多吗?你只关心你自己吗?我不想让斯莱特林赢得学院杯，那样你就会失去我从麦格教授那里得到的关于转换魔法的所有分数。” “Go away.” “走开。” “All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so—” “好吧，但我警告过你，你只要记住我说的话，当你明天在回家的火车上，你是如此-” But what they were, they didn’t find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower. 但是他们没有发现。赫敏转向胖夫人的画像想进去，却发现自己面对着一幅空画。胖夫人晚上去拜访了，赫敏被锁在格兰芬多塔楼外面。 “Now what am I going to do?” she asked shrilly. “现在我该怎么办呢?”她尖声问道。 “That’s your problem,” said Ron. “We’ve got to go, we’re going to be late.” “那是你的问题。”“我们得走了，我们要迟到了。” They hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them. 他们还没走到走廊尽头，赫敏就赶上了他们。 “I’m coming with you,” she said. “我和你一起去，”她说。 “You are not.” “你不是。” “D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I’ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.” “你以为我会站在这儿等费尔奇来抓我吗?”如果他找到我们三个，我会告诉他真相，我想阻止你，你可以支持我。 “You’ve got some nerve — ” said Ron loudly. “你有胆量——”罗恩大声说。 “Shut up, both of you!” said Harry sharply. I heard something.” “闭嘴，你们两个!”哈利厉声说。我听见有什么声音。” It was a sort of snuffling. 那是一种抽鼻子的声音。 “Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the dark. “夫人。诺里斯吗?罗恩喘着气，眯着眼睛穿过黑暗。 It wasn’t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer. 不是诺里斯太太。这是内维尔。他蜷缩在地板上，睡得很熟，但当他们蹑手蹑脚地走近时，他突然惊醒了。 “Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for hours, I couldn’t remember the new password to get in to bed.” “谢天谢地，你找到我了!”我在外面已经好几个小时了，我都记不起上床睡觉的新密码了。” “Keep your voice down, Neville. The password’s ‘Pig snout’ but it won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone off somewhere.” “小声点，纳威。”密码是‘猪鼻子’，但现在没用了，那个胖女人哪儿去了。” “How’s your arm?” said Harry. “你的手臂怎么样了?”哈利说。 “Fine,” said Neville, showing them. “Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.” “好吧。”纳威指给他们看。“庞弗雷夫人一分钟就把它修好了。” “Good — well, look, Neville, we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later—” “很好——好吧，纳威，我们得找个地方，一会儿见——” “Don’t leave me!” said Neville, scrambling to his feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s been past twice already.” “不要离开我!纳威说着，急忙站了起来，“我不想一个人呆在这儿，那该死的男爵已经走过两次了。” Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville. 罗恩看了看表，然后愤怒地瞪着赫敏和纳威。 “If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.” “你们两个真麻烦！要是我还记得屈拉教的定身术是怎么用的话，我一定会拿你们两个来开刀！” Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward. 赫敏张开嘴，也许是想告诉罗恩怎样使用魔咒，但哈利嘘了她一声，让她安静下来，并示意他们都往前走。 They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room. 他们沿着走廊飞跑，走廊上高高的窗户上挂着一道道月光。每次转弯，哈利都以为会碰上费尔奇或诺里斯太太，但他们很幸运。他们加速上了通往三楼的楼梯，踮着脚尖朝奖杯陈列室走去。 Malfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by. 马尔福和克拉布还没到。月光下，水晶奖杯盒闪闪发光。杯子、盾牌、盘子和雕像在黑暗中闪烁着金银。他们沿着墙壁侧身而行，眼睛盯着房间两头的门。哈利拿出魔杖，以防马尔福跳了进来，马上就跳了起来。时间一分一秒地过去了。 “He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” Ron whispered. “他迟到了，也许他害怕了。” Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy. 然后隔壁房间里的噪音使他们吓了一跳。哈利刚举起魔杖，就听到有人说话——不是马尔福。 “Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.” “嗅一嗅，我的宝贝，它们可能躲在角落里。” It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch’s voice. Neville’s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room. 是费尔奇在和诺里斯太太说话。哈利吓坏了，疯狂地向其他三个人挥手，要他们尽快跟上他。他们悄悄地跑向门口，避开费尔奇的声音。纳威的长袍刚转过拐角，他们就听到费尔奇走进了奖杯陈列室。 “They’re in here somewhere,” they heard him mutter, “probably hiding.” “他们就在这里的某个地方，”他们听见他咕哝着，“可能藏起来了。” “This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor. “走这边!哈利对其他人说了几句话，他们吓呆了，开始从满是盔甲的长廊上爬下来。他们听得见费尔奇越来越近了。纳威突然惊恐地尖叫了一声，拔腿就跑。他绊了一跤，一把抓住罗恩的腰，两个人摔倒在一件盔甲上 The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle. 叮当声和撞击声足以吵醒整座城堡。 “RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room. “快跑!”哈利喊道,他们冲下来的四个画廊,没有回头看是否窃取后——他们绕门柱而去一个走廊上另一个,哈利的领导,没有任何想法,或者他们去的地方——他们将通过一个tapestry和发现自己在一个隐藏的通道,突然一起走出教室附近的魅力,他们知道是英里奖杯的房间。 “I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering. “我想我们把他弄丢了。”哈利喘着气，靠在冰冷的墙上擦着额头。纳威弯下腰，气喘吁吁，唾沫飞溅。 “I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.” “我告诉过你，”赫敏喘着气，抓住胸口的针脚，“我告诉过你。” “We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,” said Ron, “quickly as possible.” “我们得尽快回到格兰芬多塔去，”罗恩说。 “Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry. “You realize that, don’t you? He was never going to meet you — Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.” “马尔福骗了你。”赫敏对哈利说。“你意识到了，不是吗?”他永远也见不到你了——费尔奇知道奖杯陈列室里会有人，马尔福肯定已经向他通风报信了。 Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t going to tell her that. 哈利认为她可能是对的，但他不打算告诉她。 “Let’s go.” “我们走吧。” It wasn’t going to be that simple. They hadn’t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them. 事情没那么简单。他们刚走了十几步，一个门把手嘎吱嘎吱地响了起来，一个东西从他们面前的教室里冲了出来。 It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight. 是皮皮鬼。他看见他们，高兴得尖叫起来。 “Shut up, Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown out.” “闭嘴，皮皮鬼——求求你——你会把我们赶出去的。” Peeves cackled. 皮皮鬼咯咯地笑。 “Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.” “半夜里到处闲逛，伊克尔·弗斯提斯?”啧,啧,啧。淘气，淘气，你会被抓的。” “Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.” “如果你不出卖我们，皮皮鬼，请不要。” “Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. “It’s for your own good, you know.” “我应该告诉费尔奇，”皮皮鬼用一种神圣的声音说，但他的眼睛里闪烁着邪恶的光芒。“你知道，这是为了你好。” “Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake. “给我让开。”罗恩厉声喝道，一拳打在皮皮鬼身上——这可大错特错了。 “STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bellowed, “STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!” “同学们起床了!”皮皮鬼吼道，“学生们从床上爬起来，沿着魔咒走廊往下走!” Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door — and it was locked. 他们躲在皮皮鬼的下面逃命，一直跑到走廊尽头，撞在一扇门上——门是锁着的。 “This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, “We’re done for! This is the end!” “这是它!他们无助地推着门，罗恩呻吟道，“我们完了!”这就是结局!” They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves’s shouts. 他们听到了脚步声，费尔奇以最快的速度朝皮皮鬼的喊声跑去。 “Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, “Alohomora!” “哦，过来。”赫敏咆哮道。她抓起哈利的魔杖，轻敲了一下锁，小声说:“阿洛霍莫拉!” The lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening. 门锁咔哒一声打开了——他们挤进去，迅速关上，把耳朵贴在门上，静听着。 “Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. “Quick, tell me.” “他们走哪条路，皮皮鬼?”费尔奇说。“快,告诉我。” “Say ‘please.’” “说‘请’。” “Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go ?” “别惹我，皮皮鬼，他们到哪儿去了?” “Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice. “如果你不说‘请’，我就什么也不说。”皮皮鬼用他那恼人的歌声说。 “All right — please.” “好吧——请吧。” “NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing if you didn’t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage. “没什么!哈haaa !告诉过你，如果你不说求求你，我什么也不会说!哈哈!Haaaaaa !他们听见皮皮鬼咆哮着走开，费尔奇愤怒地咒骂着。 “He thinks this door is locked,” Harry whispered. “I think we’ll be okay — get off, Neville!” For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry’s bathrobe for the last minute. “What ?” “他认为这扇门是锁着的。”“我想我们会没事的——下吧，纳威!”因为纳威在最后一分钟一直在拉哈利的浴袍袖子。“什么?” Harry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he’d walked into a nightmare — this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far. 哈利转过身来——很清楚地看到了什么。有那么一刻，他确信自己走进了一场噩梦——在迄今发生的一切之上，这实在是太可怕了。 They weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden. 他们并不像他想象的那样在一个房间里。他们在走廊里。三楼的禁走廊。现在他们知道为什么禁止了。 They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. 他们直视着一只巨大的狗的眼睛，这只狗占据了天花板和地板之间的整个空间。它有三个头。三双翻来覆去、疯狂的眼睛;三个鼻子朝他们的方向抽动着、颤动着;三个流口水的嘴，唾液挂在光滑的绳子从黄色的毒牙。 It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant. 它一动不动地站着，六只眼睛都盯着他们。哈利知道，它们之所以没有死，唯一的原因是它们的突然出现让它吃了一惊。 Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, he’d take Filch. 哈利摸索着找门把手——在费尔奇和死神之间，他要抓住费尔奇。 They fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn’t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared — all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn’t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor. 他们向后倒了下去——哈利砰的一声把门关上，他们跑了起来，几乎要飞了，沿着走廊跑了下去。费尔奇一定是跑到别的什么地方去找他们了，因为他们哪儿也没看见他，可是他们根本不在乎——他们只想在他们和那个怪物之间尽可能地多留点空间。他们一直跑到七楼那个胖女人的画像前。 “Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces. “你们到底到哪儿去了?”她看着他们挂在肩上的浴袍和通红、汗流浃背的脸问道。 “Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs. “别管那个——猪鼻子，猪鼻子。”哈利气喘吁吁地说。他们爬进公共休息室，战战兢兢地瘫倒在扶手椅上。 It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he’d never speak again. 过了好一会儿，他们谁也没说什么。纳威看上去确实像是再也不会说话了。 “What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?” said Ron finally. “If any dog needs exercise, that one does.” “他们以为他们在干什么，把这样的东西锁在学校里?”罗恩说。“如果有狗需要锻炼，那只狗就需要。” Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. “You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she snapped. “Didn’t you see what it was standing on. 赫敏的口气和坏脾气都恢复了。“你们谁也不用眼睛，是吗?””她厉声说。“你没看见它站在什么上面吗?” “The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.” “地板?”哈利建议。“我没有看它的脚，我太忙于它的头了。” “No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s obviously guarding something.” “不，不是地板。”它站在活板门上。它显然是在守卫什么东西。 She stood up, glaring at them. 她站起来，怒视着他们。 “I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed — or worse, expelled. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.” “我希望你们会吸取教训。今天晚上我们差点儿丢了性命——或者，全得被开除。好了，我回去睡觉了。” Ron stared after her, his mouth open. 罗恩张大嘴巴，盯着她的身后。 “No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged her along, wouldn’t you. “快点走吧。”他说。“都是她拖累了我们，哈利你说对不对？” But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something⋯ What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide — except perhaps Hogwarts. 但是当哈利爬回床上时，他还在想着赫敏的话。那只狗是在看守着一些东西……海格曾经说过什么？他说世界上最保险的保险库在格林高斯银行——除霍格瓦彻学校外。 It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was. 看来哈利已经找到了713号金库的那个肮脏的小包裹。 J.K.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s StoneChapter Nine The Midnight DuelHarry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn’t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday — and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together. “Typical,” said Harry darkly. “Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.” He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else. “You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” said Ron reasonably. “Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that’s all talk.” Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn’t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he’d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who’d listen about the time he’d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie’s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn’t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move. Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she’d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground. Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn’t learn by heart out of a book — not that she hadn’t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy’s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table. A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke. “It’s a Remembrall!” he explained. “Gran knows I forget things — this tells you if there’s something you’ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red — oh⋯ ” His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “⋯ you’ve forgotten something⋯” Neville was trying to remember what he’d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand. Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash. “What’s going on?” “Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.” Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table. “Just looking,” he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him. At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance. The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left. Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. “Well, what are you all waiting for?” she barked. “Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.” Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles. “Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called Madam Hooch at the front, “and say ‘Up!’” “UP” everyone shouted. Harry’s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger’s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville’s hadn’t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville’s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground. Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he’d been doing it wrong for years. “Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,” said Madam Hooch. “Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle — three — two—” But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch’s lips. “Come back, boy!” she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and — WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight. Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his. “Broken wrist,” Harry heard her mutter. “Come on, boy — it’s all right, up you get.” She turned to the rest of the class. “None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.” Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him. No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter. “Did you see his face, the great lump?” The other Slytherins joined in. “Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil. “Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. “Never thought you’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.” “Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. “It’s that stupid thing Longbottom’s gran sent him.” The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up. “Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch. Malfoy smiled nastily. “I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about — up a tree?” “Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn’t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, “Come and get it, Potter!” Harry grabbed his broom. “No!” shouted Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told us not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.” Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he’d found something he could do without being taught — this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron. He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned. “Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off that broom!” “Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried. Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping. “No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,” Harry called. The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy. “Catch it if you can, then!” he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground. Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down — next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball — wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching — he stretched out his hand — a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist. “HARRY POTTER!” His heart sank faster than he’d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling. “Never — in all my time at Hogwarts—” Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, ” — how dare you — might have broken your neck—” “It wasn’t his fault, Professor—” “Be quiet, Miss Patil—” “But Malfoy—” “That’s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.” Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall’s wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he’d done it. He hadn’t even lasted two weeks. He’d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn’t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid’s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag. Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside. “Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?” Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him? But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick’s class looking confused. “Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry. “In here.” Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard. “Out, Peeves!” she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys. “Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood — I’ve found you a Seeker.” Wood’s expression changed from puzzlement to delight. “Are you serious, Professor?” “Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “The boy’s a natural. I’ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?” Harry nodded silently. He didn’t have a clue what was going on, but he didn’t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs. “He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood. “Didn’t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn’t have done it.” Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once. “Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked excitedly. “Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall explained. “He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. “Light — speedy — we’ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.” “I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks⋯” Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry. “I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.” Then she suddenly smiled. “Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.” “You’re joking.” It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d forgotten all about it. “Seeker ?” he said. “But first years never — you must be the youngest house player in about—” “— a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. “Wood told me.” Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry. “I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.” Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over. “Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us. We’re on the team too — Beaters.” “I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,” said Fred. “We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.” “Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s found a new secret passageway out of the school.” “Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.” Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle. “Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?” “You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and you’ve got your little friends with you,” said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl. “I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy. “Tonight, if you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only — no contact. What’s the matter? Never heard of a wizard’s duel before, I suppose?” “Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around. “I’m his second, who’s yours?” Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up. “Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? We’ll meet you in the trophy room; that’s always unlocked.” When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. “What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry. “And what do you mean, you’re my second?” “Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry’s face, he added quickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.” “And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?” “Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron suggested. “Excuse me.” They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger. “Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron. Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry. “I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying—” “Bet you could,” Ron muttered. “— and you mustn’t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if you’re caught, and you’re bound to be. It’s really very selfish of you.” “And it’s really none of your business,” said Harry. “Good-bye,” said Ron. All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn’t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as “If he tries to curse you, you’d better dodge it, because I can’t remember how to block them.” There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness — this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn’t miss it. “Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better go.” They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, “I can’t believe you’re going to do this, Harry.” A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown. “You!” said Ron furiously. “Go back to bed!” “I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, “Percy — he’s a prefect, he’d put a stop to this.” Harry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering. “Come on,” he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole. Hermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose. “Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don’t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.” “Go away.” “All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so—” But what they were, they didn’t find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower. “Now what am I going to do?” she asked shrilly. “That’s your problem,” said Ron. “We’ve got to go, we’re going to be late.” They hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them. “I’m coming with you,” she said. “You are not.” “D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I’ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.” “You’ve got some nerve — ” said Ron loudly. “Shut up, both of you!” said Harry sharply. I heard something.” It was a sort of snuffling. “Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the dark. It wasn’t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer. “Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for hours, I couldn’t remember the new password to get in to bed.” “Keep your voice down, Neville. The password’s ‘Pig snout’ but it won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone off somewhere.” “How’s your arm?” said Harry. “Fine,” said Neville, showing them. “Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.” “Good — well, look, Neville, we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later—” “Don’t leave me!” said Neville, scrambling to his feet, “I don’t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s been past twice already.” Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville. “If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.” Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward. They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room. Malfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by. “He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” Ron whispered. Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak — and it wasn’t Malfoy. “Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.” It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch’s voice. Neville’s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room. “They’re in here somewhere,” they heard him mutter, “probably hiding.” “This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor. The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle. “RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room. “I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering. “I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, “I — told — you.” “We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,” said Ron, “quickly as possible.” “Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry. “You realize that, don’t you? He was never going to meet you — Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.” Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t going to tell her that. “Let’s go.” It wasn’t going to be that simple. They hadn’t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them. It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight. “Shut up, Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown out.” Peeves cackled. “Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.” “Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.” “Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. “It’s for your own good, you know.” “Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake. “STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bellowed, “STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!” Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door — and it was locked. “This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, “We’re done for! This is the end!” They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves’s shouts. “Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, “Alohomora!” The lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening. “Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. “Quick, tell me.” “Say ‘please.’” “Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go ?” “Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice. “All right — please.” “NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing if you didn’t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage. “He thinks this door is locked,” Harry whispered. “I think we’ll be okay — get off, Neville!” For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry’s bathrobe for the last minute. “What ?” Harry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he’d walked into a nightmare — this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far. They weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden. They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant. Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, he’d take Filch. They fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn’t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared — all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn’t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor. “Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces. “Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs. It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he’d never speak again. “What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?” said Ron finally. “If any dog needs exercise, that one does.” Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. “You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she snapped. “Didn’t you see what it was standing on. “The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.” “No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s obviously guarding something.” She stood up, glaring at them. “I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed — or worse, expelled. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.” Ron stared after her, his mouth open. “No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged her along, wouldn’t you. But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something⋯ What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide — except perhaps Hogwarts. It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was. J.K. Rowling Harry Potter &amp; The Sorcerer’s Stone]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s StoneChapter Four The Keeper of the Keys 第八章 斯内普 “There, look.” “在那儿，看！” “Where?” “在哪里?” “Next to the tall kid with the red hair.” “在那个红头发的高个子孩子旁边。” “Wearing the glasses?” “戴着眼镜?” “Did you see his face?” “你看见他的脸了吗?” “Did you see his scar?” “你看到他的伤疤了吗?” Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes. 哈利第二天一离开宿舍，就有人窃窃私语。教室外面排着队的人踮起脚尖想看他一眼，或者在走廊里又折回来从他身边经过，盯着他看。哈利希望他们不要这样，因为他正努力集中精力寻找去上课的路。 There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk. 霍格沃茨有一百四十二层楼梯:又宽又平;窄,摇摇晃晃的;有些在周五会带来不同的结果;有些人在半空中消失了一步，你必须记得跳下去。有些门是不会开的，除非你礼貌地问他们，或者在正确的地方挠他们痒痒。有些门根本不是门，只是坚固的墙在假装。也很难记起任何东西在哪里，因为它们似乎都在不停地移动。画像上的人总是互相拜访，哈利确信盔甲能行走。 The ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!” 鬼魂也没有帮忙。当其中一扇门突然从你想要打开的门里滑进来时，总是令人震惊的。差点没头的尼克总是很高兴地为格兰芬多的新生指出正确的方向，但如果你在上课迟到的时候遇到闹鬼的皮皮鬼，那它抵得上两扇上锁的门和一个恶作剧楼梯。他会把废纸篓扔到你的头上，把地毯从你的脚下拖下来，用小粉笔扔向你，或者从你身后偷偷摸摸地溜走，看不见你，抓住你的鼻子，然后尖声叫道:“把你的钥匙拿走!” Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn’t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing. 如果可能的话，比皮皮鬼更糟糕的是看守人阿格斯·费尔奇。第一天早上，哈利和罗恩就惹毛了他。费尔奇发现他们正试图强行穿过一扇门，不幸的是，这扇门原来是三楼禁止入内走廊的入口。他不相信他们迷路了，他肯定他们是故意闯进来的，还威胁说要把他们锁在地牢里，这时奇洛教授正好路过，把他们救了出来。 Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch’s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she’d whisk off for Filch, who’d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick. 费尔奇养了一只叫诺里斯太太的猫，这是一只骨瘦如柴、满身灰尘的动物，眼睛鼓鼓的，像灯一样，跟费尔奇的眼睛一模一样。她独自在走廊上巡逻。在她面前打破规矩，只把一个脚趾伸到线外，她就会飞快地朝费尔奇跑去，两秒钟后费尔奇就气喘吁吁地出现了。费尔奇比任何人都知道学校的秘密通道(也许韦斯莱家的双胞胎除外)，他能像鬼魂一样突然出现。学生们都恨他，许多人最大的愿望就是好好地踢一踢诺里斯太太。 And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words. 其实只要你努力地去找那些神奇的门和楼梯，你会学到很多东西的。哈利很快就发现，这些比挥挥魔杖说说有趣的咒语的那些魔法要深奥多了。 They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up. 他们必须在每周三午夜通过望远镜研究夜空，学习不同恒星的名字和行星的运动。他们每周去城堡后面的温室里三次，和一个叫斯普劳特教授的矮胖的小女巫一起学习草药学。在那里，他们学会了如何照料所有奇怪的植物和真菌，并弄清了它们的用途。毫无疑问，最无聊的课是魔法史，这是唯一一门由鬼魂讲授的课。宾斯教授在教工室的炉火前睡着了，第二天早上起来教书时，他已经很老了，把自己的身体留在身后。宾斯一边咕哝着，一边写下名字和日期，把邪恶的催吐剂和古怪的尿酸剂搞混了。 Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. 符咒课老师弗立维教授是一个矮小的巫师，他必须站在一堆书上才能看到桌子上方。第一节课刚开始，他就开始点名。当他叫到哈利的名字时，他兴奋地尖叫了一声，然后就倒在地上看不见了。 Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class. 麦格教授又变了。哈利认为她不是一个可以越过的老师，这是完全正确的。她既严厉又聪明，给他们讲了话——直到他们在她的第一节课上坐下的那一刻。 “Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” she said. “Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.” “变形术是霍格沃茨最复杂、最危险的魔法之一，”她说。“在我班上胡闹的人都会离开，再也不会回来了。”你已经被警告过了。 Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren’t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile. 然后她把她的桌子变成了一头猪，又变回来了。他们都印象深刻，迫不及待地想要动手，但很快就意识到，在很长一段时间内，他们都不会把家具变成动物。在做了很多复杂的笔记之后，他们每人都得到了一根火柴，并开始试着把它变成一根针。到这节课结束时，只有赫敏·格兰杰对她的比赛产生了影响;麦格教授向全班同学展示了它是如何变成银色和尖尖的，并罕见地对赫敏笑了笑。 The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren’t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went. 大家都很期待的课程是《黑魔法防御术》，但奇洛的课最后变成了一个笑话。他的教室里弥漫着大蒜的味道，每个人都说这是为了赶走他在罗马尼亚遇到的一个吸血鬼，他担心有朝一日会回来抓他。他告诉他们，他的头巾是一位非洲王子送给他的，是为了感谢他赶走了一只麻烦的僵尸，但他们不确定自己是否相信这个故事。首先，当西莫·芬尼根急切地询问奇洛是如何击退僵尸的时候，奇洛的脸一下子红了，开始谈论起天气来;另一方面，他们注意到头巾上有一种奇怪的气味，韦斯莱兄弟坚持说帽子里也塞满了大蒜，这样奇洛无论走到哪里都能得到保护。 Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn’t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have much of a head start. 哈利发现自己并没有落在别人后面好几英里，感到很宽慰。许多人都来自麻瓜家庭，和他一样，根本不知道他们是巫师。要学的东西太多了，即使是像罗恩这样的人也没有多少先机。 Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once. 星期五对哈利和罗恩来说是重要的一天。他们终于找到了去大厅吃早餐的路，一次也没迷路。 “What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge. “今天我们得到了什么?”罗恩往麦片粥里加糖时，哈利问。 “Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. “Snape’s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” “斯莱特林的两种魔药。”斯内普是斯莱特林学院的院长。他们说他总是喜欢他们——我们会看看这是不是真的。” “Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn’t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before. “真希望麦格教授能偏爱我们。”麦格教授是格兰芬多学院的院长，但这并没有阻止她前一天给他们布置了一大堆作业。 Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps. 就在这时，邮件来了。哈利已经习惯了这种现在,但它给了他一个冲击第一的早晨,当约一百猫头鹰突然涌入人民大会堂在早餐,盘旋,直到它们看到它们的主人并把信件和包裹扔到主人们的膝盖上为止。 Hedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl: 海德薇到目前为止还没有给哈利带来任何东西。她有时会飞过来咬他的耳朵，吃点烤面包片，然后和其他猫头鹰一起睡在猫头鹰窝里。可是今天早上，她在果酱和糖碗之间飞来飞去，往哈利的盘子里扔了一张纸条。哈利立刻把它撕开。上面潦草地写着: Dear Harry, 亲爱的哈利, I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? 我知道你星期五下午休息，所以三点左右来和我一起喝杯茶好吗? I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig. 我想听听你第一周的情况。给我们回海德薇的信。 Hagrid 海格 Harry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again. 哈利借了罗恩的羽毛笔，在信的背面潦草地写着“太好了，到时见！”，然后又把海德薇打发走了。 It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far. 哈利能和海格一起喝茶真是太幸运了，因为魔药课是到目前为止发生在他身上最糟糕的事情。 At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong. Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated him. 开学宴会上，哈利觉得斯内普教授不喜欢他。在第一节魔药课结束时，他知道自己错了。斯内普并不讨厌哈利——他恨他。 Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls. 药剂课在一个地牢里进行。这里比主城堡里还冷，如果没有满墙都是泡在玻璃瓶里的腌动物，那就够恐怖的了。 Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name. 斯内普和弗立维一样，一上课就点名。他和弗立维一样，一听到哈利的名字就停了下来。 “Ah, Yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — celebrity.” “啊，是的，”他轻声说，“哈利·波特。我们的新明星。” Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid’s, but they had none of Hagrid’s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels. 德拉科·马尔福和他的朋友克拉布、高尔在背后窃笑。斯内普叫完了名字，抬头看着全班同学。他的眼睛和海格的一样黑，但没有海格的温暖。它们又冷又空，让你想起黑暗的隧道。 “You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,” he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word — like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. “As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses⋯ I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.” “你来这里是为了学习制作药剂的精细科学和精确艺术，”他开始说。他说话的声音几乎只有耳语，但每个字他们都听得一清二楚——就像麦格教授一样，斯内普有一种不费力气就能让全班保持安静的天赋。“因为这里很少有人愚蠢地挥舞魔杖，你们中的许多人很难相信这是魔法。我不指望你会真正理解的美丽温柔酝酿大锅闪闪发光的气体,液体,蠕变的微妙的力量通过人体静脉,迷人的心灵,牵扯了感官⋯我可以教你如何瓶名声,酿造荣耀,甚至塞死——如果你不一样大的一群笨蛋我通常不得不教。” More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn’t a dunderhead. 这番简短的讲话之后，大家更加沉默了。哈利和罗恩扬起眉毛交换了一下眼色。赫敏·格兰杰坐在座位边上，一脸绝望地想要证明自己不是傻瓜。 “Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?” “波特!斯内普突然说。“如果我把水仙粉加到艾草汁里，会得到什么?” Powdered root of what to an infusion of what ? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione’s hand had shot into the air. 粉末状的根要注入什么?哈利瞥了罗恩一眼，罗恩看上去和他一样不知所措;赫敏的手飞向了空中。 “I don’t know, sir,” said Harry. “我不知道，先生。” Snape’s lips curled into a sneer. 斯内普撅起嘴唇冷笑起来。 “Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.” “啧啧，啧啧——名气显然不是一切。” He ignored Hermione’s hand. 他没有理睬赫敏的手。 “Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?” “让我们再试一次。波特，如果我让你给我找一块牛黄，你会去哪儿找?” Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter. 赫敏把她的手举得高高的，就像离开座位时一样，可是哈利一点也不知道牛黄是什么东西。他尽量不去看马尔福、克拉布和高尔，他们都笑得发抖。 “I don’t know, sir.” “我不知道，先生。” “Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?” Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys’, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ? “我想你不会在来之前就把书打开吧，是吗，波特?”哈利强迫自己直视着那双冰冷的眼睛。他已经翻遍了德思礼家的书，可是斯内普还指望他记得《一千个魔法药草和菌类》里的一切吗? Snape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand. 斯内普仍然无视赫敏颤抖的手。 “What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?” “蒙蹄草和狼毒有什么区别，波特?” At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling. 听了这话，赫敏站了起来，手伸向地牢的天花板。 “I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione does, though, why don’t you try her?” “我不知道。”哈利平静地说。“不过，我想赫敏知道，你为什么不试试她呢?” A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased. 有几个人笑了;哈利吸引了西莫的目光，西莫眨了眨眼。然而斯内普并不高兴。 “Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren’t you all copying that down?” “坐下。”他厉声对赫敏说。“告诉你吧，波特、水仙和艾草可以制成一种强大的安眠药，被称为‘活的死亡之药’。”牛黄是取自山羊胃里的一种石头，它能使你免受大多数毒物的伤害。至于乌头和乌头，它们是同一种植物，也叫附子。好吗?你们为什么不都抄下来?” There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.” 人们突然翻找羽毛笔和羊皮纸。在喧闹声中，斯内普说，“你的脸会被扣分的，波特。” Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. 格兰芬多的情况并没有随着魔药课的继续而有所改善。斯内普把他们分成两组，让他们混合一种简单的药水来治疗疖子。他披着黑色的长斗篷四处张望，看着他们称干荨麻的重量，咬碎蛇牙，几乎批评了所有人，除了马尔福，他似乎喜欢马尔福。他正要告诉大家看看马尔福是如何完美地烹煮他的长角蛞蝓的，这时，一阵酸溜溜的绿色烟雾和一声响亮的嘶嘶声充满了地牢。纳威不知怎么地把西莫的坩埚熔成了一个扭曲的小团，他们的药水渗到石头地板上，在人们的鞋子上烧出了洞。不出几秒钟，全班同学都站在凳子上，纳威倒在坩埚里的时候已经被药水浸透了。他的胳膊和腿上长满了红色的疖子，他痛苦地呻吟着。 “Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. “I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?” “白痴男孩!斯内普咆哮着，一挥魔杖，把溢出的药水一扫而光。“我想你是在把坩埚从火上取下来之前加上豪猪刺的吧?” Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. 纳威鼻子上长满了疖子，呜咽起来。 “Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville. “把他送到医院去。”斯内普朝西莫啐了一口唾沫。然后他转向哈利和罗恩，他们一直在纳威旁边干活。 “You — Potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.” “你——波特——你为什么不告诉尼维尔炖这种药时是不能加入豪猪尖刺的？你是想着，他要是做错了，你就有好戏看了，对不对？你在格兰芬多又丢了一分。” This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron. 这太不公平了，哈利张开嘴想争辩，罗恩却在他们的坩埚后面踢他。 “Don’t push it,” he muttered, “I’ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.” “别推它，”他咕哝着，“我听说斯内普有时会变得很恶毒。” As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week — why did Snape hate him so much? 一个小时后，当他们爬出地牢的台阶时，哈利的脑子里飞快地转着，情绪低落。在入学的第一周，他就为格兰芬多丢了两分——斯内普为什么那么恨他? “Cheer up,” said Ron, “Snape’s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?” “振作起来，”罗恩说，“斯内普总是拿弗雷德和乔治的分。我能和你一起去见海格吗? At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door. 五点差三分，他们离开城堡，穿过广场。海格住在禁林边的一间小木屋里。前门外面有一把弩和一双胶鞋。 When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid’s voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.” 哈利敲门时，他们听到里面传来一阵疯狂的拼字游戏声和几声响亮的吠声。然后海格的声音响了起来:“回来，牙牙。” Hagrid’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open. 海格把门拉开时，他那张毛茸茸的大脸出现在裂缝里。 “Hang on,” he said. “Back, Fang.” “等一下，”他说。“回来,方。” He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound. 他让他们进来，拼命想抓住一只巨大的黑色猎狗的项圈。 There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it. 里面只有一个房间。天花板上挂着火腿和野鸡，一只铜水壶在明火上烧着，角落里有一张大床，上面盖着一床拼布被子。 “Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked. “别客气，”海格说，放开牙牙。牙牙猛地扑向罗恩，开始舔他的耳朵。和海格一样，牙牙显然不像他看上去那么凶狠。 “This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate. “这是罗恩。”哈利对海格说。海格正在往一只大茶壶里倒开水，把蛋糕放到盘子里。 “Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s freckles. I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.” ”另一个韦斯莱,嗯?海格说着，瞥了一眼罗恩的雀斑。我花了半辈子的时间从森林里追你的双胞胎兄弟。” The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry’s knee and drooled all over his robes. 哈利和罗恩把他们第一次上课的事告诉了海格，假装很享受。牙牙把他的头靠在哈利的膝盖上，在长袍上流口水。 Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git.” 哈利和罗恩听到海格叫费尔奇“那个老家伙”，都很高兴。 “An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can’t get rid of her — Filch puts her up to it.” “至于那只猫，诺里斯太太，我想找个时间把她介绍给方太太。”你知道吗，每次我去学校，她都跟着我?不能摆脱她——费尔奇怂恿她的。” Harry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students. 哈利把斯内普的课告诉了海格。海格和罗恩一样告诉哈利不要担心，斯内普几乎不喜欢任何一个学生。 “But he seemed to really hate me.” “但他似乎真的很恨我。” “Rubbish!” said Hagrid. “Why should he?” “胡说！”海格说，”他干嘛要讨厌你呢？” Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet his eyes when he said that. 然而，哈利不禁想到海格说这话时并没有直视他的眼睛。 “How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron. “I liked him a lot — great with animals.” “你弟弟查理怎么样?”海格问罗恩。“我很喜欢他——和动物相处得很好。” Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet : 哈利想知道海格是不是故意改变了话题。罗恩向海格讲述了查理和龙的关系，哈利拿起茶托下面桌子上的一张纸。这是《预言家日报》上的一段话: GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST 古灵阁磨合最新 Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown. 7月31日发生在古灵阁的入室盗窃事件仍在继续调查，人们普遍认为这是不明身份的黑巫师所为。 Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day. 古灵阁的妖精们今天坚称什么也没有被拿走。事实上，搜查的金库当天就空了。 “But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. 古灵阁的一位发言人今天下午说:“但我们不会告诉你里面有什么，所以如果你知道什么对你有好处，就别多管闲事。” Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date. 哈利记得罗恩在火车上告诉他，有人企图抢劫古灵阁，但罗恩没有提到日期。 “Hagrid!” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might’ve been happening while we were there!” “海格!哈利说，“古灵阁被盗是在我生日那天发生的!”也许我们在那儿的时候就发生过!” There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn’t meet Harry’s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for? 这是毫无疑问的，海格这次肯定没有看到哈利的眼睛。他咕哝了一声，又给了他一块石头蛋糕。哈利又读了一遍故事。事实上，当天早些时候搜查的金库已经被清空。海格已经掏空了713个金库里的东西，如果你能把它叫做“掏空”的话，那就是拿出了那个肮脏的小包裹。那是小偷要找的东西吗? As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he’d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn’t want to tell Harry? 哈利和罗恩走回城堡吃晚饭，口袋里塞满了他们出于礼貌拒绝不了的石头蛋糕。哈利想，到目前为止，他所上过的课中，没有一门课比和海格喝茶更值得他去思考。海格及时地收到了包裹吗?现在它在哪里?海格知道一些他不想告诉哈利的关于斯内普的事吗? J.K.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s StoneChapter Eight The Potions Master“There, look.” “Where?” “Next to the tall kid with the red hair.” “Wearing the glasses?” “Did you see his face?” “Did you see his scar?” Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes. There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk. The ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!” Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn’t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing. Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch’s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she’d whisk off for Filch, who’d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick. And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words. They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class. “Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” she said. “Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.” Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren’t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile. The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren’t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went. Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn’t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have much of a head start. Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once. “What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge. “Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. “Snape’s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them — we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” “Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn’t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before. Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps. Hedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl: Dear Harry, I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig. Hagrid Harry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again. It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far. At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong. Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated him. Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls. Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name. “Ah, Yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — celebrity.” Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid’s, but they had none of Hagrid’s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels. “You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,” he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word — like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. “As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses⋯ I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.” More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn’t a dunderhead. “Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?” Powdered root of what to an infusion of what ? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione’s hand had shot into the air. “I don’t know, sir,” said Harry. Snape’s lips curled into a sneer. “Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.” He ignored Hermione’s hand. “Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?” Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter. “I don’t know, sir.” “Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?” Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys’, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ? Snape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand. “What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?” At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling. “I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione does, though, why don’t you try her?” A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased. “Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren’t you all copying that down?” There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.” Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. “Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. “I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?” Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. “Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville. “You — Potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.” This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron. “Don’t push it,” he muttered, “I’ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.” As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week — why did Snape hate him so much? “Cheer up,” said Ron, “Snape’s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?” At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door. When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid’s voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.” Hagrid’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open. “Hang on,” he said. “Back, Fang.” He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound. There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it. “Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked. “This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate. “Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s freckles. I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.” The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry’s knee and drooled all over his robes. Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old git.” “An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can’t get rid of her — Filch puts her up to it.” Harry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students. “But he seemed to really hate me.” “Rubbish!” said Hagrid. “Why should he?” Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet his eyes when he said that. “How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron. “I liked him a lot — great with animals.” Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet : GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown. Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day. “But we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date. “Hagrid!” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might’ve been happening while we were there!” There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn’t meet Harry’s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for? As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they’d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he’d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn’t want to tell Harry? J.K.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s StoneChapter Seven The Sorting Hat 第七章 分院帽 The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry’s first thought was that this was not someone to cross. 门立刻开了。站在那里的是一个高高的黑发女巫，穿着墨绿色的长袍。她的脸很严肃，哈利的第一个念头是要通过她的课可能很难。 “The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid. “是第一学年，麦格教授。”海格说。 “Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.” “谢谢你,海格。我要把他们从这里带走。 She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors. 她把门开得很大。入口大厅大得可以装得下德思礼一家的全部房子。石墙上点着像古灵阁那样熊熊燃烧的火把，天花板高得看不清，对面有一座宏伟的大理石楼梯通往楼上。 They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously. 他们跟着麦格教授穿过铺着石板的地板。哈利能听到从右边门口传来的几百个低沉的声音——学校的其他人肯定已经到了——但麦格教授把新生们带进了大厅外一间空无一人的小房间。他们挤了进来，站得比平时更近了，紧张地四处张望。 “Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room. “欢迎来到霍格沃茨。”麦格教授说。开学宴会马上就要开始了，但是在你们进入礼堂就座之前，你们将被分到自己的房间里。分院是一个非常重要的仪式，因为当你在这里的时候，你的房子就像你在霍格沃茨的家人一样。你将和你的房子的其他部分一起上课，睡在你的房子宿舍，在你的房子公共休息室度过空闲时间。 “The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours. 这四个学院分别叫做格兰芬多、赫奇帕奇、拉文克劳和斯莱特林。每家都有自己高贵的历史，每家都出了杰出的男女巫师。当你在霍格沃茨的时候，你的胜利会给你加分，而任何违反规则的行为都会被扣分。在年底，学院获得的积分最多的是学院杯，这是一个很大的荣誉。我希望你们每个人都能为你们的学院增光添彩。 “The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.” 分院仪式几分钟后将在全校师生面前举行。我建议你们在等候的时候，尽量打扮一下自己。” Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair. 她的目光在纳威的斗篷上停留了一会儿，那件斗篷夹在他的左耳下面，还有罗恩那脏兮兮的鼻子上。哈利紧张地想把头发弄平。 “I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.” “我们准备好了就回来。”麦格教授说。“请安静地等候。” She left the chamber. Harry swallowed. 她离开了房间。哈里吞下。 “How exactly do they sort us into houses?” he asked Ron. “他们是怎么把我们分门别类的?”他问罗恩。 “Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.” “我想是某种考验吧。弗雷德说很疼，但我想他是在开玩笑。” Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn’t know any magic yet — what on earth would he have to do? He hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He’d never been more nervous, never, not even when he’d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his teacher’s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom. 哈利的心猛地一震。一个测试吗?当着全校的面?但是他还不知道任何魔法——他究竟要做什么呢?他们一到，他就没想到会发生这样的事。他不安地环顾四周，发现其他人看起来也很害怕。除了赫敏格兰杰，没人多说话。她飞快地低声说着她学过的咒语，不知道自己需要什么咒语。哈利竭力不听她的话。他从来没有像现在这样紧张过，从来没有像现在这样紧张过，甚至当他不得不把一份成绩单带回德思礼家说他不知怎么把老师的假发染成了蓝色的时候。他目不转睛地盯着门。现在，麦格教授随时都可能回来，把他引向毁灭。 Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air — several people behind him screamed. 然后发生了一件事，使他在空中跳了大约一英尺——他身后的几个人尖叫起来。 “What the — ?” “什么——?” He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance—” 他气喘吁吁地说。他周围的人也是如此。大约有二十个鬼魂刚刚从后墙里窜了出来。他们的脸白得像珍珠一样，有点透明，他们在房间里踱来踱去，彼此交谈着，头几年几乎不看一眼。他们似乎在争吵。一个胖胖的小和尚在说:“原谅他，忘记他，我说，我们应该给他第二次机会——” “My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he’s not really even a ghost — I say, what are you all doing here?” “我亲爱的修士，难道我们没有给皮皮鬼应有的一切机会吗?”他给我们大家带来了坏名声，你知道，他实际上连个鬼都不是——我说，你们在这儿干什么?” A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years. 一个戴着领结、穿着紧身衣的鬼魂突然注意到了新生们。 Nobody answered. 没有人回答。 “New students!” said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. “About to be Sorted, I suppose?” “新同学!胖修士微笑着说。“我想是要被分类了吧?” A few people nodded mutely. 有几个人默默地点了点头。 “Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar. “My old house, you know.” “希望在赫奇帕奇见到你!””修士说。“我的老房子，你知道。” “Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting Ceremony’s about to start.” “走吧，”一个尖利的声音说。“分院仪式就要开始了。” Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall. 麦格教授回来了。鬼魂们一个接一个地从对面的墙上飘走了。 “Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and follow me.” “现在，排成一排，”麦格教授对新生们说，“跟我来。” Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall. 哈利感到很奇怪，他的腿好像变成了领头的，他跟在一个沙色头发的男孩后面排好队，罗恩跟在他后面。 Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, “Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.” 哈利从来没有想到会有这样一个奇怪而又美丽的地方。它被成千上万的蜡烛照亮，这些蜡烛漂浮在四张长桌子的半空中，其他的学生都坐在桌子上。这些桌子上摆着闪闪发光的金盘子和高脚杯。在大厅的顶部是另一张长桌子，老师们正坐在那里。麦康娜教授把一年级的学生带到这里来，所以他们面对着其他学生排成一列，停了下来，后面跟着老师。数以百计的人盯着他们看，就像闪烁的烛光下苍白的灯笼。在学生们中间，鬼魂们散布在各处，发出朦胧的银光。哈利抬头一看，只见天鹅绒般的黑色天花板上星星点点。他听见赫敏低声说:“像外面的天空一样是被施了魔法的。我在《霍格沃茨的历史》中读到过。 It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the heavens. 很难相信那里有一个天花板，而且大殿并不是简单地对着天空开放的。 Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard’s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let it in the house. 当麦格教授默默地把一张四脚凳放在新生面前时，哈利迅速地低下头来。她在凳子上放了一顶尖尖的巫师帽。这顶帽子打了补丁，又破又脏。佩妮姨妈不会让它进屋子的。 Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the hat began to sing: “也许他们得想办法从帽子里弄出一只兔子来，”哈利狂乱地想，“好像是这样的——他注意到大厅里的每个人都在盯着帽子看，他也盯着帽子看。”有几秒钟，一片寂静。然后帽子抽动了一下。帽沿附近的一条缝裂开了，像张大嘴——帽子唱起歌来: “Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, “哦，你可能不认为我漂亮， But don’t judge on what you see, 但不要根据你看到的来判断， I’ll eat myself if you can find 如果你能找到，我就自己吃 A smarter hat than me. 比我聪明的帽子。 You can keep your bowlers black, 你可以让你的保龄球保持黑色， Your top hats sleek and tall, 你的高帽子又高又光滑， For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat 因为我是霍格沃茨分院帽 And I can cap them all. 我可以把它们都加起来。 There’s nothing hidden in your head 你脑子里什么都没有 The Sorting Hat can’t see, 分院帽看不见， So try me on and I will tell you 试试我，我会告诉你的 Where you ought to be. 你该去的地方。 You might belong in Gryffindor, 你可能属于格兰芬多， Where dwell the brave at heart, 勇敢的人住在哪里， Their daring, nerve, and chivalry 他们的勇敢、勇气和骑士精神 Set Gryffindors apart; 格兰芬多分开; You might belong in Hufflepuff, 你可能属于赫奇帕奇， Where they are just and loyal, 他们公正忠诚， Those patient Hufflepuffs are true 那些耐心的赫奇帕奇学生是对的 And unafraid of toil; 不怕辛苦; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you’ve a ready mind, 或者在聪明的老拉文克劳，如果你头脑灵活， Where those of wit and learning, 那些有智慧和学识的人， Will always find their kind; 将永远找到他们的同类; Or perhaps in Slytherin 或者在斯莱特林 You’ll make your real friends, 你会交到真正的朋友， Those cunning folk use any means 那些狡猾的人不择手段 To achieve their ends. 达到他们的目的。 So put me on! Don’t be afraid! 所以让我穿上吧!不要害怕! And don’t get in a flap! 别慌! You’re in safe hands (though I have none) 你现在很安全(虽然我没有) For I’m a Thinking Cap!” 因为我是一顶会思考的帽子!” The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again. 帽子唱完歌，全场爆发出热烈的掌声。它向四张桌子各鞠了一躬，然后又静了下来。 “So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to Harry. “I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.” “所以我们得试试这顶帽子!”罗恩小声对哈利说。“我要杀了弗雷德，他正在和巨魔摔跤呢。” Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him. 哈利微微一笑。是的，戴上这顶帽子比施魔法好多了，但他真希望他们能在没有人观看的情况下戴上它。帽子似乎问了很多问题;哈利此刻觉得自己既不勇敢，也不机智。如果这顶帽子提到的房子是给那些感觉有点恶心的人住的，那就太适合他了。 Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment. 麦格教授这时走上前来，手里拿着一卷羊皮纸。 “When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,” she said. “Abbott, Hannah!” 她说:“当我叫到你的名字时，你就把帽子戴上，坐在凳子上整理。”“阿伯特,汉娜!” A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause — 一个粉红脸蛋、扎着金色马尾辫的女孩从队伍里跌跌撞撞地走了出来，戴上帽子，帽子正好落在她的眼睛上，她坐了下来。片刻的停顿- “HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat. “赫奇帕奇!帽子喊道。 The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her. 当汉娜走到赫奇帕奇的桌旁坐下时，右边的桌子上响起了欢呼声和掌声。哈利看见胖修士的鬼魂高兴地向她挥手。 “Bones, Susan!” “骨头,苏珊!” “HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah. “赫奇帕奇!帽子又叫了一声，苏珊急忙跑开，坐在汉娜的旁边。 “Boot, Terry!” “引导,特里!” “RAVENCLAW!” “拉文克劳!” The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them. 左边第二张桌子这次拍手;当特里加入他们时，几个拉文克劳人站起来和他握手。 “Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling. “布罗克赫斯特，曼迪”也去了拉文克劳，但是“布朗，拉文德”成了格兰芬多的第一个新生，最左边的桌子上爆发出一阵欢呼声;哈利看见罗恩的孪生兄弟在叫他。 “Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. “布尔斯特罗德，米莉森特”后来成了斯莱特林人。也许这是哈利的想象，毕竟他听说过斯莱特林，但他觉得他们看起来很不讨人喜欢。 He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him. 他现在开始觉得很不舒服。他记得在他以前的学校里，他在体育课上被选为队员。他总是最后一个被选中，不是因为他不好，而是因为没有人希望达力认为他们喜欢他。 “Finch-Fletchley, Justin!” “Finch-Fletchley,贾斯汀!” “HUFFLEPUFF!” “赫奇帕奇!” Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor. 哈利注意到，有时帽子会立刻把屋子里的人都喊出来，但有时又过了一会儿才做出决定。“芬尼根，西莫，”队伍里哈利旁边那个沙头发的男孩在凳子上坐了将近一分钟，帽子才宣布他是格兰芬多。 “Granger, Hermione!” “格兰杰,赫敏!” Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head. 赫敏几乎跑到凳子上，迫不及待地把帽子塞到头上。 “GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned. “格兰芬多!帽子喊道。罗恩呻吟着。 A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you’re very nervous. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on the train? 哈利突然想到了一个可怕的念头，就像你紧张的时候经常想到的那样。如果他根本没有被选中呢?如果他一直戴着帽子坐在那里，直到麦格教授突然把帽子从头上摘下来，说他肯定是弄错了，最好还是回到火车上，那该怎么办? When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to “MacDougal, Morag.” 当不断失去癞蛤蟆的纳威·隆巴顿被叫来的时候，他在去凳子的路上摔倒了。帽子花了很长时间才和纳威商量好。最后它叫道:“格兰芬多。”纳威仍然穿着它跑开了，在一阵哄堂大笑中，他不得不慢慢地跑回来，把它给了“麦克道戈尔，莫拉格。” Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!” 当叫到马尔福的名字时，他大摇大摆地走上前，立刻实现了自己的愿望:帽子刚碰到他的头，它就尖叫起来:“斯莱特林!” Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself. 马尔福走到他的朋友克拉布和高尔身边，看上去很高兴。 There weren’t many people left now. “Moon”⋯, “Nott”⋯, “Parkinson”⋯, then a pair of twin girls, “Patil” and “Patil”⋯, then “Perks, Sally-Anne”⋯, and then, at last — 现在已经没有多少人了。“月亮”⋯⋯“诺特”,“帕金森”⋯,然后一对双胞胎女儿,“帕蒂尔”和“帕蒂尔”⋯,然后“福利,sally anne”⋯,然后,最后 “Potter, Harry!” “波特,哈利!” As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall. 哈利走上前去时，突然传来一阵窃窃私语，像一堆嘶嘶作响的小火，传遍了大厅。 “Potter, did she say?” “波特，她说什么?” “The Harry Potter?” “《哈利·波特》?” The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited. 在帽子掉下来遮住眼睛之前，哈利最后看到的是大厅里挤满了伸长脖子想好好看看他的人。下一秒钟，他看到了帽子里面的黑色。他等待着。 “Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, A my goodness, yes — and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting⋯ So where shall I put you?” “嗯，”一个细小的声音在他耳边说。“困难。非常困难的。我知道你很有勇气。也不是一个坏主意。有人才,我的天啊,是的,一个渴望证明自己,现在这很有趣⋯所以我放你哪里?” Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin. 哈利抓住凳子边缘，心想，不是斯莱特林，不是斯莱特林。 “Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!” “不是斯莱特林,嗯?小声音说。“你确定吗?你可以变得伟大，你知道，这一切都在你的脑海里，斯莱特林会帮助你走向伟大，毫无疑问，不是吗?好吧，如果你敢肯定——最好是格兰芬多!” Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water. 哈利听见帽子对着整个大厅喊着最后一个字。他脱下帽子，摇摇晃晃地走向格兰芬多的餐桌。他被选中而没有入选斯莱特林，这让他松了一口气，他几乎没有注意到自己得到了最热烈的欢呼。级长珀西站起身来，使劲地握着他的手，韦斯莱家的孪生兄弟喊道:“我们抓到波特了!”我们得到了波特!哈利在他刚才看到的那个戴着花环的鬼魂对面坐了下来。鬼魂拍了拍他的胳膊，哈利突然感到自己的胳膊掉进了一桶冰冷的水里。 He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban. 他现在能看清那张高桌子了。在离他最近的一头坐着海格，海格引起了他的注意，竖起了大拇指。哈利咧嘴一笑。在那张高桌子的中央，一把金色的大椅子上坐着阿不思·邓布利多。哈利一眼就认出了他，那是他在火车上从巧克力青蛙里拿出的卡片。邓布利多的银发是整个大厅里唯一像鬼魂一样闪闪发光的东西。哈利也认出了奇洛教授，那个从破釜酒吧出来的紧张的年轻人。他戴着一顶紫色的大头巾，看上去很特别。 And now there were only three people left to be sorted. “Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin, Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!” 现在只剩下三个人需要分类了。“托马斯，迪恩，”一个比罗恩还高的黑人男孩和哈利一起坐在格兰芬多的桌子旁。“特品，丽莎。”变成了拉文克劳，然后轮到罗恩了。他现在已经是浅绿色的了。哈利在桌下交叉手指，一秒钟后，帽子就喊道:“格兰芬多!” Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him. 罗恩瘫倒在他旁边的椅子上，哈利和其他人一起大声鼓掌。 “Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away. “干得好，罗恩，太棒了。”珀西·韦斯莱傲慢地对哈利说，“布莱斯，扎比尼”是斯莱特林出身。麦格教授卷起卷轴，把分院帽拿走了。 Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago. 哈利低头看着他的空金盘。他才意识到自己有多饿。南瓜馅饼似乎是很久以前的事了。 Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there. 阿不思·邓布利多站了起来。他对学生们笑逐颜开，双臂张开，好像没有什么比看到他们都在那里更令他高兴的了。 “Welcome,” he said. “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! “欢迎你,”他说。“欢迎来到霍格沃茨的新年!”在我们开始宴会之前，我想说几句话。他们来了:笨蛋!鲸脂!零头!调整! “Thank you!” “谢谢你!” He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not. 他又坐了下来。每个人都鼓掌欢呼。哈利不知道该不该笑。 “Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly. “他——有点生气吗?”他迟疑地问珀西。 “Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?” “疯了吗?珀西轻快地说。“他是一个天才!世界上最好的巫师!但是他有点疯，是的。土豆,哈利?” Harry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs. 哈利张大了嘴巴。他面前的盘子里堆满了食物。他从来没有见过这么多他喜欢在一张桌子上吃的东西:烤牛肉、烤鸡肉、猪排和羊排、香肠、熏肉和牛排、煮土豆、烤土豆、炸薯条、约克郡布丁、豌豆、胡萝卜、肉汁、番茄酱，而且，出于某种奇怪的原因，还有薄荷糖。 The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious. 德思礼一家从来没有真正让哈利挨饿过，但从来没有允许他想吃多少就吃多少。达力总是拿走哈利真正想要的任何东西，即使这会让他感到恶心。哈利在盘子里堆满了除了薄荷糖以外的所有东西，然后开始吃起来。一切都很美味。 “That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak. “看起来不错。”皱着眉头的鬼魂看着哈利切牛排，悲伤地说。 “Can’t you — ?” “你不能——?” “I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said the ghost. “I don’t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don’t think I’ve introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.” “我有将近五百年没吃东西了。”“当然，我不需要，但有人会想念它。”我想我没有介绍过自己吧?尼古拉斯·德·米姆西·波平顿爵士随时为您效劳。格兰芬多塔的常驻鬼魂。 “I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me about you — you’re Nearly Headless Nick!” “我知道你是谁!”罗恩突然说。“我的哥哥们跟我说起过你——你差点就是无头尼克!” “I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy — ” the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted. “我倒希望你叫我尼古拉斯·德·米西爵士——”鬼魂僵硬地说，但满头白发的西莫·芬尼根打断了他的话。 “Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?” “差点没头的?你怎么能几乎无头呢?” Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going at all the way he wanted. 尼古拉斯爵士看上去非常生气，好像他们的小谈话完全不像他想要的那样进行。 “Like this,” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin ghost.” “就像这样，”他不耐烦地说。他抓住左耳用力拉。他的整个头从脖子上掉了下来，落在肩膀上，就像挂在铰链上一样。显然有人想把他斩首，但没有做得很好。看到他们惊愕的表情，差点没头的尼克显得很高兴。他把脑袋转到脖子上，咳嗽了一声，说:“格兰芬多新生!”我希望你能帮我们赢得今年的冠军。格兰芬多从来没有这么长时间没有赢过球。斯莱特林队已经连续六年获得这个奖杯了!血男爵变得几乎无法忍受了——他就是斯莱特林的鬼魂。” Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements. 哈利朝斯莱特林那边的桌子望去，看见一个可怕的鬼魂坐在那里，两眼茫然，面容憔悴，长袍上沾满了银色的血迹。他就在马尔福的旁边。哈利高兴地看到，马尔福对座位安排不太满意。 “How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest. “他怎么全身都是血?”西莫很感兴趣地问。 “I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately. “我从没问过。”差点没头的尼克小心翼翼地说。 When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding⋯ 当每个人都尽可能多地吃完后，剩下的食物就从盘子里消失了，像以前一样闪闪发光。过了一会儿，甜点端上来了。块的冰淇淋在你能想到的每一种滋味,苹果馅饼,糖蜜挞,和果酱甜甜圈,要巧克力泡芙条蛋糕,草莓,果冻,大米布丁⋯ As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families. 哈利一边吃着蜜糖馅饼，一边把话题转到他们的家人身上。 “I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle. Mom didn’t tell him she was a witch ‘til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.” “我是一半一半，”西莫说。“我爸爸是个麻瓜。”直到他们结婚后，妈妈才告诉他她是个女巫。这对他来说是个严重的打击。” The others laughed. 其他人笑了。 “What about you, Neville?” said Ron. “你呢，纳威?””罗恩说。 “Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” said Neville, “but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me — he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.” “嗯，我奶奶把我养大的，她是个女巫，”纳威说，“可是家里人一直认为我是个十足的麻瓜。我的伯祖父阿尔吉总是试图在我毫无防备的情况下抓住我，强迫我施展一些魔法——有一次他把我从布莱克浦码头的尽头推下去，我差点被淹死——但直到我八岁之前，什么都没发生。埃尔吉舅公来吃晚饭的时候，他把我吊在楼上的一个窗户外的脚踝上。但是我跳了起来——沿着花园一直跳到路上。他们都很高兴，奶奶哭了，她很高兴。当我进来的时候，你应该看看他们的脸——他们认为我可能没有足够的魔力来这里，你看。大叔叔阿吉很高兴给我买了癞蛤蟆。 On Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult — “; “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — “). 在哈利的另一边，珀西·韦斯莱和赫敏正在谈论功课(“我真希望他们马上就开始，要学的东西太多了，我对变形术特别感兴趣，你知道，把东西变成别的东西，当然，这应该很难——”)。“你会从小处开始，只是把火柴变成针之类的东西——”)。 Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin. 哈利感到又热又困，又抬头看了看高高的桌子。海格深深地喝着他的酒杯。麦格教授正在和邓布利多教授谈话。奇洛教授戴着他那顶可笑的无边帽，正跟一位油黑头发、鹰钩鼻、皮肤蜡黄的老师说话。 It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead. 事情发生得很突然。鹰钩鼻子的老师越过奇洛的头巾，直勾勾地盯着哈利的眼睛，哈利额头上的伤疤一阵剧痛。 “Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head. “哎哟!哈利用手拍了拍自己的头。 “What is it?” asked Percy. “怎么了?”珀西问道。 “N-nothing.” “没——没什么。” The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at all. 疼痛来得快去得也快。更难摆脱的是哈利从老师的眼神中得到的感觉——一种他根本不喜欢哈利的感觉。 “Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy. “那个和奇洛教授谈话的老师是谁?”他问珀西。 “Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to — everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.” “哦，你已经认识奇洛了，是吗?”难怪他看起来这么紧张，那是斯内普教授。他教魔药课，但他不想——大家都知道他是在找奇洛的工作。斯内普，他对黑魔法知道得太多了。” Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again. 哈利盯着斯内普看了一会儿，但斯内普再也没有看他一眼。 At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. 最后，甜点也不见了，邓布利多教授又站了起来。大厅里鸦雀无声。 “Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. “嗯——再说几句话，现在我们都吃饱喝足了。”我有一些开学通知要通知你。 “First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.” “一年级的学生应该注意，操场上的森林是禁止所有学生进入的。我们的一些年长的学生也应该记住这一点。 Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins. 邓布利多闪烁的眼睛朝着韦斯莱双胞胎的方向望去。 “I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. “管理员费尔奇先生还让我提醒你们，走廊里的课间休息时间不能使用魔法。 “Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch. 魁地奇选拔赛将在学期的第二周举行。任何有兴趣为本队效力的人都应该联系霍琦夫人。 “And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.” “最后，我必须告诉你们，今年，右边三楼走廊禁止任何不希望死得非常痛苦的人进入。” Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. 哈利笑了，但他是少数几个笑的人之一。 “He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy. “他不是认真的吗?他小声对珀西说。 “Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere — the forest’s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.” “一定是。”珀西皱着眉头对邓布利多说。“这很奇怪，因为他通常会给我们一个不允许我们去任何地方的理由——森林里到处都是危险的野兽，每个人都知道这一点。”我想他至少会告诉我们级长吧。” “And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!” cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles had become rather fixed. “现在，在我们睡觉前，让我们唱校歌吧!””邓布利多叫道。哈利注意到其他老师的笑容都僵住了。 Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words. 邓布利多轻轻挥了一下魔杖，仿佛要把苍蝇从魔杖的一端弄下来似的，一条长长的金色丝带从魔杖里飞了出来，高高挂在桌子上方，像蛇一样扭动着，变成了一字一句。 “Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, “and off we go!” “每个人都选自己喜欢的曲子，”邓布利多说，“我们走吧!” And the school bellowed: 学校里的人吼道: “Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, “霍格沃茨，霍格沃茨，多疣的霍格沃茨， Teach us something please, 请教我们一些东西， Whether we be old and bald 无论我们是老是秃 Or young with scabby knees, 或者年轻时膝盖结痂， Our heads could do with filling 我们的头脑需要充实 With some interesting stuff, 用一些有趣的东西， For now they’re bare and full of air, 现在它们是光秃秃的，充满了空气， Dead flies and bits of fluff, 死苍蝇和一些绒毛， So teach us things worth knowing, 所以教我们一些值得知道的事情， Bring back what we’ve forgot, just do your best, we’ll do the rest, 把我们遗忘的东西找回来，尽你所能，我们会完成剩下的。 And learn until our brains all rot.” 学习，直到我们的大脑腐烂。” Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest. 每个人在不同的时间唱完了这首歌。最后，只剩下韦斯莱家的双胞胎跟着葬礼进行曲缓慢地唱了起来。邓布利多用魔杖指挥了他们最后几句台词。当他们唱完的时候，他是掌声最响亮的人之一。 “Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!” “啊，音乐，”他擦着眼泪说。“一种超越我们在这里所做的一切的魔法!”现在,睡觉。你刚学步的小孩!” The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry’s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt. 一年级的格兰芬多学生跟着珀西穿过叽叽喳喳的人群，走出大会堂，走上大理石楼梯。哈利的腿又像铅了，但那只是因为他太累了，又吃饱了。他太困了，连走廊上挂着画像的人经过时都在低声指指点点，或者珀西两次领着他们穿过隐藏在滑动嵌板和挂毯后面的门廊，他都不觉得奇怪。他们又爬了几级楼梯，打着呵欠，拖着脚。哈利正在纳闷他们还得走多远，突然停了下来。 A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him. 一捆拐杖漂浮在他们前面的半空中，珀西向他们迈了一步，他们开始扑向他。 “Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years. “A poltergeist.” He raised his voice, “Peeves — show yourself.” “皮皮鬼，”珀西对新生们低声说。“吵闹鬼。他提高了声音，“皮皮鬼——快出来。” A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered. 一个响亮而粗鲁的声音，就像气球里的空气，回答道。 “Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?” “你要我去血男爵那儿吗?” There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. 砰的一声，一个长着邪恶的黑眼睛和大嘴巴的小个子男人出现了，盘腿浮在空中，手里抓着拐杖。 “Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle Firsties! What fun!” “Oooooooh !他邪恶地咯咯笑着说。“Ickle Firsties !什么乐趣!” He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. 他突然向他们猛扑过去。他们都回避。 “Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I mean it!” barked Percy. “走开，皮皮鬼，不然男爵会听到这件事的，我是说真的!”“叫珀西。 Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville’s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed. 皮皮鬼伸出舌头不见了，手杖掉在纳威的头上。他们听见他飞驰而去，走过时铠甲格格作响。 “You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as they set off again. “The Bloody Baron’s the only one who can control him, he won’t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.” “你要当心皮皮鬼，”珀西说着，他们又出发了。“血腥男爵是唯一能控制他的人，他甚至不听我们长官的话。”我们在这里。” At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress. 在走廊的尽头挂着一幅画，画上是一个穿着粉红色丝绸衣服的胖女人。 “Password?” she said. “密码?”她说。 “Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up — and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. “德古尼斯角。”珀西说着，画像向前一摆，露出墙上的一个圆洞。他们都爬了过去——纳威需要站起来——发现自己来到了格兰芬多公共休息室，一个舒适的圆形房间，里面摆满了皱巴巴的扶手椅。 Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the towers — they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed. 珀西引导女孩们从一扇门进入宿舍，男孩们从另一扇门进入。在螺旋形楼梯的顶端，他们终于找到了自己的床:五张四柱床，挂着深红色天鹅绒窗帘。他们的箱子已经搬上来了。他们累得说不出话来，便穿上睡衣上床睡觉了。 “Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. “Get off, Scabbers! He’s chewing my sheets.” “很棒的食物，不是吗?”罗恩透过衣架小声对哈利说。“下车,斑斑!他在嚼我的床单。” Harry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once. 哈利正要问罗恩有没有吃糖浆馅饼，但他几乎马上就睡着了。 Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking. 也许哈利吃得太多了，因为他做了一个很奇怪的梦。他戴着奇洛教授的头巾，上面不停地跟他说话，告诉他必须马上转到斯莱特林去，因为这是他的命运。哈利告诉头巾，他不想呆在斯莱特林;它变得越来越重;他试图把它但它加强了痛苦,马尔福,嘲笑他他纠结,那么马尔福变成鹰钩鼻的老师,斯内普,他的笑变得高和冷——有一阵绿光和哈利醒来,出汗和颤抖。 He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn’t remember the dream at all. 他翻了个身，又睡着了。第二天醒来时，他根本不记得做了什么梦。 J.K.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s StoneChapter Seven The Sorting HatThe door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry’s first thought was that this was not someone to cross. “The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid. “Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.” She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors. They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously. “Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room. “The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours. “The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.” Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair. “I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.” She left the chamber. Harry swallowed. “How exactly do they sort us into houses?” he asked Ron. “Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.” Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn’t know any magic yet — what on earth would he have to do? He hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He’d never been more nervous, never, not even when he’d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his teacher’s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom. Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air — several people behind him screamed. “What the — ?” He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance—” “My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he’s not really even a ghost — I say, what are you all doing here?” A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years. Nobody answered. “New students!” said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. “About to be Sorted, I suppose?” A few people nodded mutely. “Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar. “My old house, you know.” “Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting Ceremony’s about to start.” Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall. “Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and follow me.” Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall. Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, “Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.” It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the heavens. Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard’s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let it in the house. Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the hat began to sing: “Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, But don’t judge on what you see, I’ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me. You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all. There’s nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can’t see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be. You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you’ve a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You’ll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends. So put me on! Don’t be afraid! And don’t get in a flap! You’re in safe hands (though I have none) For I’m a Thinking Cap!” The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again. “So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to Harry. “I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.” Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him. Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment. “When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,” she said. “Abbott, Hannah!” A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause — “HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat. The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her. “Bones, Susan!” “HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah. “Boot, Terry!” “RAVENCLAW!” The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them. “Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling. “Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him. “Finch-Fletchley, Justin!” “HUFFLEPUFF!” Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor. “Granger, Hermione!” Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head. “GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned. A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you’re very nervous. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on the train? When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to “MacDougal, Morag.” Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!” Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself. There weren’t many people left now. “Moon”⋯, “Nott”⋯, “Parkinson”⋯, then a pair of twin girls, “Patil” and “Patil”⋯, then “Perks, Sally-Anne”⋯, and then, at last — “Potter, Harry!” As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall. “Potter, did she say?” “The Harry Potter?” The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited. “Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, A my goodness, yes — and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting⋯ So where shall I put you?” Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin. “Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!” Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water. He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban. And now there were only three people left to be sorted. “Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin, Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!” Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him. “Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away. Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago. Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there. “Welcome,” he said. “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! “Thank you!” He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not. “Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly. “Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?” Harry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs. The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious. “That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak. “Can’t you — ?” “I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said the ghost. “I don’t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don’t think I’ve introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.” “I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me about you — you’re Nearly Headless Nick!” “I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy — ” the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted. “Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?” Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going at all the way he wanted. “Like this,” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin ghost.” Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements. “How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest. “I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately. When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding⋯ As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families. “I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle. Mom didn’t tell him she was a witch ‘til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.” The others laughed. “What about you, Neville?” said Ron. “Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” said Neville, “but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me — he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.” On Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult — “; “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing — “). Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin. It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead. “Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head. “What is it?” asked Percy. “N-nothing.” The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at all. “Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy. “Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to — everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.” Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again. At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. “Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. “First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.” Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins. “I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. “Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch. “And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.” Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. “He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy. “Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere — the forest’s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.” “And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!” cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles had become rather fixed. Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words. “Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, “and off we go!” And the school bellowed: “Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach us something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, Our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now they’re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, So teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we’ve forgot, just do your best, we’ll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot.” Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest. “Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!” The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry’s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt. A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him. “Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years. “A poltergeist.” He raised his voice, “Peeves — show yourself.” A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered. “Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?” There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. “Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle Firsties! What fun!” He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. “Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I mean it!” barked Percy. Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville’s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed. “You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as they set off again. “The Bloody Baron’s the only one who can control him, he won’t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.” At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress. “Password?” she said. “Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up — and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the towers — they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed. “Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. “Get off, Scabbers! He’s chewing my sheets.” Harry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once. Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking. He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn’t remember the dream at all. J.K. Rowling Harry Potter &amp; The Sorcerer’s Stone]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s StoneChapter Six The Journey from Platform Nine and Three-quarters 第六章 从九又四分之三站台开始的旅程 Harry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. 哈利和德思礼一家在一起的最后一个月并不有趣。的确，达力现在非常害怕哈利，不愿和他呆在同一个房间里，而佩妮姨妈和维能姨丈也没有把哈利关在柜子里，没有强迫他做任何事，也没有对他大喊大叫——事实上，他们根本不和他说话。他们半害怕，半愤怒，表现得好像哈利坐的椅子都是空的。虽然这在很多方面是一个进步，但过了一段时间后，它确实变得有点令人沮丧。 Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first. 哈利呆在自己的房间里，和他的新猫头鹰做伴。他决定叫她海德薇，这是他在魔法史上找到的一个名字。他的课本很有趣。他躺在床上看书，一直读到深夜，海德薇高兴地从开着的窗户里飞进飞出。幸好佩妮姨妈不再来吸尘了，因为海德薇老是把死老鼠带回来。每天晚上睡觉前，哈利都会在钉在墙上的那张纸上再打上一天的记号，倒数到9月1日。 On the last day of August he thought he’d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King’s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room. 八月的最后一天，他想他最好和他的叔叔婶婶谈谈第二天去国王十字车站的事，于是他来到客厅，他们正在看电视上的一个智力竞赛节目。他清了清嗓子，让他们知道他在那儿。达力尖叫着跑出了房间。 “Er — Uncle Vernon?” “呃——弗农姨父?” Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. 弗农姨父哼了一声，表示他在听。 “Er — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — to go to Hogwarts.” “呃——我明天得去国王十字车站——去霍格沃茨。” Uncle Vernon grunted again. 弗农姨父又咕哝了一声。 “Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?” “你可以载我一程吗?” Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. 咕哝。哈利以为那是肯定的。 “Thank you.” “谢谢你。” He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke. 他正要上楼去，维能姨丈居然开口了。 “Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?” “去巫师学校的火车真有趣。”魔毯都扎破了，是吗?” Harry didn’t say anything. 哈利什么也没说。 “Where is this school, anyway?” “这所学校到底在哪儿?” “I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket. “我不知道。”哈利第一次意识到这一点。他从口袋里掏出海格给他的票。 “I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o’clock,” he read. “我要在十一点整从九又四分之三站台上车,”他读道。 His aunt and uncle stared. 他的叔叔婶婶目瞪口呆。 “Platform what?” “什么站台？” “Nine and three-quarters.” “九又四分之三。” “Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no platform nine and three-quarters.” “别说废话，”弗农姨父说。“没有九又四分之三站台。” “It’s on my ticket.” “在我的票上。” “Barking,” said Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of them. You’ll see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take you to King’s Cross. We’re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.” “瞎说，”弗农姨父说，“你真是疯得够可以的了。明天你就知道了，走着瞧吧。行，我们带你去国王大道。要不是我们明天也要去伦敦，我才不会傻到自找麻烦呢。” “Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly. “你为什么要去伦敦?”哈利问道，尽量保持友好。 “Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle Vernon. “Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.” “送达力去医院。”弗农姨父咆哮道。“在他去斯梅廷之前，得把那红红的尾巴去掉。” Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want to walk into the station in his wizard’s robes — he’d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off. 第二天早上5点钟，哈利醒了，他又兴奋又紧张，再也睡不着觉。他站起来，穿上牛仔裤，因为他不想穿着巫师袍走进车站——他会在火车上换的。他又检查了一遍霍格沃茨的名单，以确保他有所需要的一切，看到海德薇被安全地关在笼子里，然后在房间里踱来踱去，等着德思礼一家起床。两个小时后，哈利那又大又重的箱子被搬上了德思礼家的车，佩妮姨妈说服达德里坐在哈利旁边，他们就出发了。 They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. 他们十点半到达国王十字车站。弗农姨父把哈利的箱子扔到一辆手推车上，把它推到了车站。哈利觉得这是一种奇怪的仁慈，直到维能姨丈面露凶恶的笑容，面朝月台上停了下来。 “Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do they?” “好了，傻小子，你到了.”九号站台——十号站台。你的平台应该在中间的某个地方，但他们似乎还没有建立它，是吗? He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all. 当然，他说得很对。在一个平台上有一个大大的塑料数字9，在它旁边的一个平台上有一个大大的塑料数字10，在中间，什么都没有。 “Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He’d have to ask someone. “祝你有个好学期。”弗农姨父说着，脸上露出了更难听的笑容。他一句话也没说就走了。哈利转过身来，看见德思礼一家开车走了。他们三个都笑了。哈利的嘴变得相当干。他到底要做什么?因为海德薇，他开始吸引很多有趣的目光。他得找人问问。 He stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said there wasn’t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl. 他拦住一个过路的卫兵，但不敢提起九又四分之三站台。警卫从来没有听说过霍格沃茨，当哈利甚至不能告诉他在这个国家的哪个地方时，他开始生气了，好像哈利是故意犯傻似的。哈利绝望地要了11点出发的火车，但列车员说没有。最后，卫兵大步走开了，嘴里嘟囔着浪费时间的话。哈利现在努力不让自己惊慌失措。根据接机板上的大钟，他还有十分钟的时间登上去霍格沃茨的火车，但他不知道该怎么做;他被困在一个车站的中央，有一只箱子他几乎提不动，口袋里装满了巫师的钱，还有一只大猫头鹰。 Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s stand between platforms nine and ten. 海格一定忘了告诉他你必须做的事情，比如敲左边第三块砖才能进入对角巷。他不知道自己是否应该拿出魔杖，开始敲打九号站台和十号站台之间检票员的柜台。 At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying. 正在这时，一群人从他身后经过，他听见他们说了几句话。 “— packed with Muggles, of course—” “-当然是麻瓜了-” Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry’s in front of him — and they had an owl. 哈利转弯了。说话的是一个胖胖的女人，她正在和四个红头发的男孩说话。他们每个人都在推着一个像哈利的箱子——他们还有一只猫头鹰。 Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying. 哈利的心怦怦直跳，他推着车跟在他们后面。他们停了下来，他也停了下来，就在他们说话的地方。 “Now, what’s the platform number?” said the boys’ mother. “现在，月台是几号?”男孩的妈妈说。 “Nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, “Mom, can’t I go⋯” “九又四分之三!”又是一个小女孩,红头发,握着她的手,“妈妈,我不能去⋯” “You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.” “你还不够大，金妮，现在安静点。”好吧，珀西，你先走。” What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it — but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished. 看起来最大的男孩朝九号和十号站台走去。哈利注视着，小心地不眨眼，以防错过——但就在男孩走到两个站台中间的隔板时，一大群游客涌到了他面前，当最后一个背包被拿走时，男孩已经不见了。 “Fred, you next,” the plump woman said. “弗雷德，下一个轮到你，”胖女人说。 “I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy. “Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can’t you tell I’m George?” “我不是弗雷德，我是乔治，”男孩说。“老实说，女人，你自称是我们的母亲?”你看不出我是乔治吗?” “Sorry, George, dear.” “对不起,乔治,亲爱的。” “Only joking, I am Fred,” said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone — but how had he done it? “开玩笑的，我是弗雷德。”男孩说着就走了。他的孪生兄弟在他身后叫他快点，他一定是这么做的，因为一秒钟后，他就走了——可他是怎么做到的呢? Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there — and then, quite suddenly, he wasn’t anywhere. 现在，第三个哥哥正轻快地朝栅栏走去——他已经快到了——然后，突然，不见了。 There was nothing else for it. 没有别的办法了。 “Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman. “对不起，”哈利对那个胖女人说。 “Hello, dear,” she said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s new, too.” “你好，亲爱的，”她说。“第一次来霍格沃茨?”罗恩也是新的。” She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose. 她指着她最小的儿子。他又高又瘦又瘦，长着雀斑，手脚很大，鼻子很长。 “Yes,” said Harry. “The thing is — the thing is, I don’t know how to—” “是的,”哈利说。“问题是——问题是，我不知道该怎么做——” “How to get onto the platform?” she said kindly, and Harry nodded. “怎么到站台上去?”她亲切地说，哈利点了点头。 “Not to worry,” she said. “All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into it, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.” “别担心，”她说。“你所要做的就是径直走到9号站台和10号站台之间的护栏处。不要停下来，不要害怕你会撞到它，这是非常重要的。如果你紧张的话，最好在跑步的时候做。走吧，走在罗恩前面。” “Er — okay,” said Harry. “呃——好吧，”哈利说。 He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid. 他推着手推车，盯着栅栏看。它看起来很结实。 He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he’d be in trouble — leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn’t be able to stop — the cart was out of control — he was a foot away — he closed his eyes ready for the crash — 他开始朝它走去。在去九号站台和十号站台的路上，人们推搡着他。哈利走得更快了。正好他要打破屏障,然后他就麻烦了,在他的三轮车上身体向前倾斜,他闯进一个沉重的运行的障碍来越来越近——他无法阻止马车失控——他是在一步之遥——他闭上眼睛准备好崩溃 It didn’t come⋯ he kept on running⋯ he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts’ Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it. 它没来⋯他继续运行⋯他睁开眼睛。一辆鲜红色的蒸汽机正等在一个挤满人的站台旁。头顶上有块牌子写着:“11点，霍格沃茨特快列车。”哈利回头一看，看见一道锻铁拱门，就在屏障所在的地方，上面写着“九又四分之三站台”。 Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks. 引擎冒出的烟从叽叽喳喳的人群头上飘过，各种颜色的猫在两腿之间到处打伤。猫头鹰在叽叽喳喳声和沉重的树干摩擦声中不满地互相鸣叫。 The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.” 最初的几节车厢里已经挤满了学生，有的挂在窗外和家人聊天，有的在争夺座位。哈利推着马车下了站台，想找个空位。他经过一个圆脸的男孩，男孩说:“奶奶，我又把癞蛤蟆弄丢了。” “Oh, Neville,” he heard the old woman sigh. “噢，纳威，”他听到老妇人叹了口气。 A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd. 一个留长发绺的男孩被一小群人包围了。 “Give us a look, Lee, go on.” “给我们看看，李，继续。” The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg. 男孩把一个盒子的盖子抱在怀里，盒子里有个东西伸出一条毛茸茸的长腿，周围的人尖叫着。 Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot. 哈利从人群中挤了过去，直到他在火车的尾部发现了一个空车厢。他先把海德薇放了进去，然后开始用力把他的箱子推到车门。他试着把它抬上台阶，但一头几乎抬不起来，有两次他痛苦地把它摔在脚上。 “Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins he’d followed through the barrier. “要帮忙吗?那是他跟着穿过栅栏的一对红头发双胞胎中的一个。 “Yes, please,” Harry panted. “是的，请。”哈利气喘吁吁地说。 “Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!” “Oy,弗雷德!麦可和帮助!” With the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment. 在双胞胎的帮助下，哈利的箱子终于被塞进了车厢的一个角落。 “Thanks,” said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes. “谢谢。”哈利说着，把满头大汗的头发从眼睛里拨开。 “What’s that?” said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry’s lightning scar. “那是什么?双胞胎中的一个突然指着哈利闪电般的伤疤说。 “Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you — ?” “天哪，”另一个双胞胎说。“你是——?” “He is,” said the first twin. “Aren’t you?” he added to Harry. “是的，”第一个双胞胎说。“是吗?他又对哈利说。 “What?” said Harry. “什么?”哈利说。 “Harry Potter.” chorused the twins. ”哈利·波特。双胞胎异口同声地说。 “Oh, him,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am.” “哦，是他。”“我是说，是的，我是。” The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train’s open door. 两个男孩呆呆地看着他，哈利觉得自己脸红了。然后，一个声音从火车敞开的门里飘了进来，使他松了一口气。 “Fred? George? Are you there?” “弗雷德?乔治?你在那里么?” “Coming, Mom.” “来了,妈妈。” With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train. 双胞胎最后看了哈利一眼，跳下了火车。 Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief. 哈利在窗边坐了下来，半掩着身子，望着台上红头发的一家人，听着他们在说些什么。他们的母亲刚刚拿出手帕。 “Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.” “罗恩，你鼻子上有东西。” The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. 最小的男孩想把他拉开，但她抓住了他，开始揉他的鼻尖。 “Mom — geroff” He wriggled free. “妈妈-放开我”他扭动着挣脱了。 “Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?” said one of the twins. “啊，罗尼的鼻子上有什么东西吗?”双胞胎中的一个说。 “Shut up,” said Ron.?“闭嘴，”罗恩说。 “Where’s Percy?” said their mother. “珀西在哪里?妈妈说。 “He’s coming now.” “他来了。” The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it. 最大的男孩大步走了进来。他已经换上霍格沃茨的黑色长袍，哈利注意到胸前有一枚闪闪发光的银色徽章，上面写着字母P。 “Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said. “I’m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves—” “呆不了多久，妈妈，”他说。“我在前面，班长们有两个包厢——” “Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. “You should have said something, we had no idea.” “哦，你是班长吗，珀西?”双胞胎中的一个带着非常惊讶的神情说。“你应该说点什么，我们不知道。” “Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,” said the other twin. “Once—” “等一下，我想我记得他说过这件事。”另一个双胞胎说。“说过一次——“ “Or twice—” “或是两次–” “A minute—” “一分钟” “All summer—” “整个夏天- - - - - -” “Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect. “哦，闭嘴。”班长伯希大声叫道。 “How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one of the twins. “珀西怎么会有新袍子呢?”双胞胎中的一个说。 “Because he’s a prefect,” said their mother fondly. “All right, dear, well, have a good term — send me an owl when you get there.” “因为他是班长，”他们的母亲深情地说。“好吧，亲爱的，祝你玩得愉快——到那儿时给我捎只猫头鹰来。” She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins. 她吻了吻珀西的脸颊，他走了。然后她转向双胞胎。 “Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up a toilet or—” “现在，你们两个——今年，你们要守规矩。如果再来一只猫头鹰告诉我你炸了厕所或者 “Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.” “炸毁厕所?”我们从来没有炸过厕所。” “Great idea though, thanks, Mom.” “好主意，谢谢你，妈妈。” “It’s not funny. And look after Ron.” “这不是有趣。照顾好罗恩。 “Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.” “别担心，罗尼金斯和我们在一起很安全。” “Shut up,” said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it. “闭嘴。”罗恩说。他几乎已经和那对双胞胎一样高了，他妈妈擦过鼻子的地方仍然是粉红色的。 “Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?” “嘿，妈妈，你猜怎么着?”猜猜我们在火车上遇到谁了?” Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him looking. 哈利迅速向后靠了靠，所以他们看不见他在看。 “You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?” “你认识车站里离我们很近的那个黑头发男孩吗?”知道他是谁吗?” “Who?” “谁?” “Harry Potter!” “哈利·波特!” Harry heard the little girl’s voice. 哈利听到了小女孩的声音。 “Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please⋯” “哦,妈妈,我可以在火车上见到他,妈妈,嗯请⋯” “You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn’t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?” “金妮，你已经见过他了，那可怜的孩子可不是你在动物园里盯着看的东西。”真的吗，弗雷德?你怎么知道?” “Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there — like lightning.” ”他问。看到他的疤痕。它就在那儿——像闪电一样。” “Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.” “可怜的宝贝——难怪他一个人，我想。当他问怎么上站台的时候，他非常有礼貌。 “Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?” “没关系，你觉得他还记得神秘人的长相吗?” Their mother suddenly became very stern. 他们的母亲突然变得非常严厉。 “I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.” “我不准你问他，弗雷德。不，你不敢。好像他在上学的第一天就需要被提醒。” “All right, keep your hair on.” “好吧，别紧张。” A whistle sounded. 汽笛的鸣叫。 “Hurry up!” their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry. “快点!妈妈说着，三个男孩爬上了火车。他们把头探出窗外，让她亲吻道别，他们的妹妹哭了起来。 “Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.” “别这样，金妮，我们会给你送来很多猫头鹰的。” “We’ll send you a Hogwarts’ toilet seat.” “我们会送你霍格沃茨的马桶盖。” “George!” “乔治!” “Only joking, Mom.” “只有在开玩笑,妈妈。” The train began to move. Harry saw the boys’ mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved. 火车开动了。哈利看见两个男孩的母亲在挥手，他们的妹妹半笑半哭地跑着，一直追着火车，直到火车加快了速度。 Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn’t know what he was going to — but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind. 火车转弯时，哈利看着女孩和她妈妈消失了。房屋从窗前闪过。哈利感到一阵兴奋。他不知道自己要做什么，但这肯定比他留下的东西要好。 The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in. 车厢的门滑开了，最小的红头发男孩走了进来。 “Anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. “Everywhere else is full.” “有人坐在那里吗?他指着哈利对面的座位问道。“其他地方都满了。” Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn’t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose. 哈利摇了摇头，男孩坐了下来。他瞥了哈利一眼，然后迅速地看了看窗外，假装没看。哈利看到他的鼻子上还有一块黑记号。 “Hey, Ron.” “嘿,罗恩。” The twins were back. 双胞胎回来了。 “Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train — Lee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.” “听着，我们要去火车中间——李·乔丹在下面有一只巨大的狼蛛。” “Right,” mumbled Ron. “没错,”罗恩咕哝着。 “Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.” “哈利，”另一个孪生兄弟说，“我们做过自我介绍吗?”弗雷德和乔治韦斯莱。这是罗恩，我们的兄弟。那么，待会儿见。” “Bye,” said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them. “再见。”哈利和罗恩说。那对孪生兄弟把车厢门推到身后关上了。 “Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out. “你真的是哈利波特吗?”罗恩脱口而出。 Harry nodded. 哈利点了点头。 “Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George’s jokes,” said Ron. “And have you really got — you know⋯” “哦——好吧，我想这可能是弗雷德和乔治的笑话。”“你真的有,你知道⋯” He pointed at Harry’s forehead. 他指着哈利的前额。 Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared. 哈利把刘海往后一拉，露出闪电般的伤疤。罗恩盯着。 “So that’s where You-Know-Who — ?” “那就是神秘人- ?” “Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.” “是的，”哈利说，“但我想不起来了。” “Nothing?” said Ron eagerly. “什么?罗恩急切地说。 “Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.” “嗯——我记得很多绿灯亮过，但别的什么都不记得。” “Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again. “哇,”罗恩说道。他坐下来，盯着哈利看了一会儿，然后，好像他突然意识到自己在做什么，他又迅速地向窗外望去。 “Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him. “你们家都是巫师吗?”哈利问，他发现罗恩和罗恩发现他一样有趣。 “Er — Yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mom’s got a second cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.” “呃——是的，我想是的。”“我想妈妈有个表妹是会计，但我们从不谈论他。” “So you must know loads of magic already.” “所以你一定已经知道很多魔法了。” The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about. 韦斯莱一家显然是那个住在对角巷的苍白男孩所说的古老巫师家庭之一。 “I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they like?” “我听说你去和麻瓜住在一起了。”“他们长得什么样?” “Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.” “可怕——嗯，不是所有的人。”但是我的姑姑、叔叔和表弟是。要是我有三个巫师兄弟就好了。” “Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. “I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy’s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it’s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, and Percy’s old rat.” “五,”罗恩说道。不知什么原因，他看上去很沮丧。“我是我们家第六个去霍格沃茨的。你可以说我有很多东西要辜负。比尔和查理已经走了——比尔是领班，查理是魁地奇队长。现在珀西是级长了。弗雷德和乔治经常胡闹，但他们仍然得到很好的分数，每个人都认为他们很有趣。每个人都希望我做得和其他人一样好，但如果我做了，也没什么大不了的，因为他们先做了。和五个兄弟在一起，你也得不到任何新的东西。我有比尔的旧袍子，查理的旧魔杖，还有珀西的老老鼠。 Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep. 罗恩把手伸进夹克，掏出一只胖胖的灰老鼠，它正在睡觉。 “His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got Scabbers instead.” “他叫斑斑，是个没用的家伙，几乎从不醒来。”珀西从我爸爸那里得到了一只猫头鹰，因为他被任命为级长，但他们不能——我的意思是，我得到了斑斑。 Ron’s ears went pink. He seemed to think he’d said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window. 罗恩的耳朵变红了。他似乎觉得自己说得太多了，因为他又开始盯着窗外看。 Harry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he’d never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up. 哈利不认为养不起猫头鹰有什么不对。毕竟，他直到一个月前才有了钱。他告诉罗恩，他不得不穿达德里的旧衣服，永远也得不到像样的生日礼物。这似乎使罗恩高兴起来。 “⋯ and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort—” ”⋯,直到海格告诉我,我不知道任何关于作为一个向导,对我的父母或者伏地魔——“ Ron gasped. 罗恩深吸一口气。 “What?” said Harry. “什么?”哈利说。 “You said You-Know-Who’s name!” said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. “I’d have thought you, of all people—” “你说的是神秘人的名字!”罗恩说，听起来既震惊又感动。“我想，在所有的人当中——” “I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,” said Harry, “I just never knew you shouldn’t. See what I mean? I’ve got loads to learn⋯ I bet,” he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, “I bet I’m the worst in the class.” “我说这个名字不是想表现得勇敢，”哈利说，“我只是不知道你不应该这么做。”明白我的意思吗?我有加载学习⋯我打赌,”他补充说,首次表示最近一直担心他的东西很多,“我敢打赌我班上最差的。” “You won’t be. There’s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.” “你不会。有很多人来自麻瓜家庭，他们学得很快。 While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past. 他们正在谈话时，火车把他们送出了伦敦。现在他们正疾驰而过满是牛羊的田野。他们安静了一会儿，看着田野和小路飞逝而过。 Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, “Anything off the cart, dears?” 大约十二点半左右，外面走廊里传来一阵嘈杂声，一个满脸酒窝的女人微笑着退到他们的门口，说道:“孩子们，想买些什么好吃的？” Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron’s ears went pink again and he muttered that he’d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor. 哈利还没吃早饭，就跳了起来，但罗恩的耳朵又红了，他咕哝着说他带了三明治。哈利走到走廊里。 He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry — but the woman didn’t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. 他从来没有钱在德思礼家买过糖果，现在口袋里的金银格格作响，他准备买尽可能多的玛氏巧克力棒——可是那个女人没有玛氏巧克力棒。她吃的是比比多味豆，朱古力吹泡泡糖，巧克力蛙。南瓜馅饼、大锅蛋糕、甘草魔杖，还有许多哈利平生从未见过的奇怪东西。为了不失去任何东西，他从每样东西中都拿了一些，给了那个女人11个银镰刀和7个铜面包圈。 Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat. 哈利把东西都拿回车厢，倒在一个空座位上，罗恩目不转睛地看着。 “Hungry, are you?” “饿了吧?” “Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty. “饿坏了。”哈利说着，咬了一大口南瓜馅饼。 Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, “She always forgets I don’t like corned beef..” 罗恩拿出一个鼓鼓囊囊的包裹，把它打开。里面有四个三明治。他把其中一个撕开说:“她总是忘记我不喜欢咸牛肉。” “Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a pasty. “Go on—” “用这个换你一个。”哈利说着，举起一个馅饼。“去,” “You don’t want this, it’s all dry,” said Ron. “She hasn’t got much time,” he added quickly, “you know, with five of us.” “你不想要这个，都干了。”“她没有多少时间，”他很快补充说，“你知道，和我们五个人在一起。” “Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry’s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). “来，吃个馅饼吧。”哈利说，他以前从来没有吃过东西，事实上，也从来没有人跟他吃过。和罗恩坐在一起，吃着哈利所有的馅饼、蛋糕和糖果(三明治被遗忘了)，这种感觉真好。 “What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. “They’re not really frogs, are they?” He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him. “这些是什么?哈利问罗恩，手里拿着一包巧克力青蛙。“它们真的不是青蛙，是吗?”他开始觉得没什么能让他吃惊的。 “No,” said Ron. “But see what the card is. I’m missing Agrippa.” “不,”罗恩说道。“但看看这张牌是什么。”我失踪的亚基帕。” “What?” “什么?” “Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect — famous witches and wizards. I’ve got about five hundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.” “哦，当然，你不会知道——巧克力青蛙里面有卡片，你知道，用来收集——著名的巫师。”我有五百个左右，却没有阿基帕和托勒密。 Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man’s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore. 哈利打开巧克力蛙的包装，拿起卡片。它显示了一个男人的脸。他戴着半月形的眼镜，长着一个又长又弯的鼻子，满头银发、络腮胡子和八字胡。照片下面是阿不思·邓布利多的名字。 “So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry. “这就是邓布利多!””哈利说。 “Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said Ron. “Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks—” “别告诉我你从没听说过邓布利多!””罗恩说。“我能吃一只青蛙吗?”我可能会得到阿格丽帕——谢谢——” Harry turned over his card and read: 哈利把卡片翻过来，念道: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE 阿不思·邓布利多 CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS 现任霍格沃茨校长 Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling. 邓布利多被许多人认为是现代最伟大的巫师，他在1945年打败了黑巫师格林德沃(Grindelwald)，发现了龙血的12种用途，还和搭档尼古拉斯勒梅(Nicolas Flamel)一起研究炼金术，这些都让他格外出名。邓不利多教授喜欢室内乐和保龄球。 Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore’s face had disappeared. 哈利把卡片翻过来，惊奇地发现邓布利多的脸不见了。 “He’s gone!” “他走了!” “Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said Ron. “He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again and I’ve got about six of her⋯ do you want it? You can start collecting.” “嗯，你不能指望他整天呆在这儿，”罗恩说。“他会回来。不,我有莫甘娜再次和我有大约六⋯你想要它吗?你可以开始收集。 Ron’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped. 罗恩的目光转向一堆等待着打开包装的巧克力青蛙。 “Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.” “随便吃，”哈利说。“但在麻瓜的世界里，人们只是停留在照片里。” “Do they? What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sounded amazed. “Weird!” “他们吗?什么，他们根本不动?罗恩听起来很吃惊。“奇怪!” Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the Druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans. 哈利瞪大了眼睛，邓布利多侧身看着他卡片上的照片，微微一笑。罗恩对吃青蛙比对那些著名的巫师卡更感兴趣，但哈利目不转睛地盯着它们。不久，他不仅得到了邓布利多和茉嘉娜，还得到了伍德克罗夫特、阿尔伯里克·格伦尼翁、瑟茜、帕拉塞尔苏斯和梅林的汉吉斯特。他终于把目光从德鲁伊女祭司克里欧娜身上移开，克里欧娜正抓着鼻子，想打开一袋比比多味豆。 “You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned Harry. “When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor — you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.” “你要小心那些东西。”罗恩警告哈利。“他们说的每一种口味，就是每一种口味——你知道，你能吃到所有普通的口味，比如巧克力、薄荷、果酱，但你也能吃到菠菜、肝脏和牛肚。”乔治估计他以前吃过鼻屎味的。” Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner. 罗恩捡起一颗绿豆，仔细地看了看，咬了一口。 “Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.” “Bleaaargh——看到了吗?麦牙味的。” They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper. 他们吃了各种口味的豆子，玩得很开心。哈利得到了吐司、椰子、烤豆、草莓、咖喱、草、咖啡、沙丁鱼，甚至还勇敢地把罗恩碰都没碰过的那根奇怪的灰色尾巴咬掉，原来是胡椒。 The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. 从窗口飞过的乡村变得越来越荒凉。整洁的田野消失了。现在有树林、蜿蜒的河流和深绿色的小山。 There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked tearful. 有人敲他们车厢的门，哈利从九又四分之三站台经过的那个圆脸男孩走了进来。他看起来泪流满面的。 “Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?” “对不起，”他说，“你看见蟾蜍了吗?” When they shook their heads, he wailed, “I’ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!” 他们摇了摇头，他哭着说:“我把他弄丢了!”他老是从我身边跑开!” “He’ll turn up,” said Harry. “他会来的，”哈利说。 “Yes,” said the boy miserably. “Well, if you see him⋯” “是的，”男孩痛苦地说。“好吧,如果你看到他⋯” He left. 他离开了。 “Don’t know why he’s so bothered,” said Ron. “If I’d brought a toad I’d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can’t talk.” “不知道他为什么这么烦恼，”罗恩说。“如果我带一只癞蛤蟆来，我会尽快把它弄丢的。”注意，我带了斑斑来，所以我不能说话。” The rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap. 老鼠还在罗恩的腿上打盹。 “He might have died and you wouldn’t know the difference,” said Ron in disgust. “I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn’t work. I’ll show you, look⋯” “他可能已经死了，你不会知道其中的区别。”罗恩厌恶地说。“昨天我试着把他变黄，让他变得更有趣，但咒语没起作用。”我将向您展示,看⋯” He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end. 他在箱子里翻来翻去，拿出一根看上去很破旧的魔杖。它有些地方有缺口，最后有个白色的东西在闪闪发光。 “Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway—” “独角兽的毛都快长出来了。”无论如何,“ He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes. 他刚举起魔杖，车厢门又滑开了。无毒虫男孩回来了，但这次他带了一个女孩。她已经穿上了霍格沃茨的新袍子。 “Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,” she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth. “有人看见蟾蜍了吗?”纳威丢了一个，”她说。她的声音专横跋扈，一头浓密的棕色头发，门牙很大。 “We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” said Ron, but the girl wasn’t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand. “我们已经告诉他我们没看见。”罗恩说，但那女孩没在听，她在看他手里的魔杖。 “Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.” “哦，你在变魔术吗?”那么，让我们看看吧。” She sat down. Ron looked taken aback. 她坐了下来。罗恩看上去吃了一惊。 “Er — all right.” “呃——好吧。” He cleared his throat. 他清了清嗓子。 “Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, “阳光，雏菊，醇厚的黄油， Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.” 把这只又笨又肥的老鼠变成黄色。 He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep. 他挥动魔杖，但什么也没发生。斑斑还是灰蒙蒙的，睡得很熟。 “Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all worked for me. Nobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I’m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?” “你确定那是真的咒语吗?””她说。“嗯，不太好，是吗?”我试过一些简单的咒语只是为了练习，对我来说都很有效。没有人在我的家人的魔法,它是这样一个惊喜当我得到我的信,但是我感到非常高兴,当然,我的意思是,它是最好的学校,我听说,我背会了我们所有的课程的书,当然,我只是希望它就够了——我是赫敏·格兰杰,顺便问一下,你是谁?” She said all this very fast. 她说得非常快。 Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either. 哈利看了看罗恩，从他惊愕的脸上看到他也没有把所有的课本都背下来，这使他松了一口气。 “I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered. “我是罗恩·韦斯莱。” “Harry Potter,” said Harry. “哈利·波特。” “Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about you, of course — I got a few extra books, for background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.” “你是真的吗?”赫敏说。“当然，我知道你的一切——我有几本额外的书，作为背景读物。你读的是现代魔法史、黑魔法的兴衰和20世纪的伟大巫师事件。” “Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed. “我?哈利感到头昏眼花地说。 “Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I could if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do either of you know what house you’ll be in? I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad⋯ Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.” “天哪，你不知道吗?如果是我的话，我会把一切都找出来的。”“你们俩有谁知道你们将住在什么房子里?”我到处打听，我希望我在格兰芬多，这听起来是最好的;我听到邓布利多本人,但我想拉文克劳不会太坏⋯不管怎样,我们最好去寻找内维尔的蟾蜍。你们两个最好换衣服，我想我们很快就到。” And she left, taking the toadless boy with her. 于是她带着那个没有癞蛤蟆的男孩走了。 “Whatever house I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.” “不管我在什么房子里，我希望她不在里面。”他把魔杖扔回箱子里。“愚蠢的咒语——是乔治给我的，我敢打赌他知道那是个哑弹。” “What house are your brothers in?” asked Harry. “你的兄弟们在什么房子里?””哈利问。 “Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. “Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.” “格兰芬多,”罗恩说道。他似乎又感到沮丧了。妈妈和爸爸也在里面。我不知道如果我不知道他们会怎么说。我不认为拉文克劳会很糟糕，但想象一下如果他们把我关进斯莱特林。 “That’s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?” “那就是沃尔——我是说，神秘人在里面的那间房子?” “Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed. “是的,”罗恩说道。他跌跌撞撞地回到座位上，神情沮丧。 “You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off houses. “So what do your oldest brothers do now that they’ve left, anyway?” “你知道，我觉得斑斑的胡须末端轻了一点。”“那么，你的哥哥们既然走了，他们现在怎么办呢?” Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he’d finished school. 哈利想知道一个巫师一毕业会做什么。 “Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,” said Ron. “Did you hear about Gringotts? It’s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the Muggles — someone tried to rob a high security vault.” “查理在罗马尼亚研究龙，比尔在非洲为古灵阁做事，”罗恩说。“你听说古灵阁的事了吗?”《预言家日报》上到处都是这样的消息，但我想麻瓜们不会有这种感觉——有人试图抢劫一个高度安全的金库。 Harry stared. 哈利盯着。 “Really? What happened to them?” “真的吗?他们怎么了?” “Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t been caught. My dad says it must’ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don’t think they took anything, that’s what’s odd. ‘Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.” “没什么，这就是为什么这是个大新闻。”他们还没有被抓住。我爸爸说一定是一个强大的黑巫师绕过了古灵阁，但他们不认为他们拿走了任何东西，这很奇怪。当然，当这样的事情发生时，每个人都会感到害怕，以防神秘人是幕后黑手。 Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying “Voldemort” without worrying. 哈利把这个消息反复地想了一遍。每次提到神秘人，他就开始感到一阵恐惧。他以为这都是进入魔法世界的一部分，但说“伏地魔”而不担心要舒服得多。 “What’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked. “你的魁地奇球队是什么?””罗恩问道。 “Er — I don’t know any.” Harry confessed. “呃——我什么也不知道。””哈利承认。 “What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s the best game in the world — ” And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he’d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time. “什么!罗恩目瞪口呆。“哦，你等一下，这是世界上最好的游戏——”他离开了，解释了所有关于四个球和七个球员的位置，描述了他和他的兄弟们去过的著名的游戏和他想要的扫帚，如果他有钱的话。他正要带哈利看比赛的精彩部分，车厢门又滑开了，但这回不是没有蟾蜍的纳威，也不是赫敏·格兰杰。 Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley. 三个男孩走了进来，哈利立刻认出了中间的那个，是马尔金夫人长袍店的那个脸色苍白的男孩。他带着比在对角巷时更浓厚的兴趣看着哈利。 “Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?” “这是真的吗?”他说。“火车上到处都在说哈利·波特在这个车厢里。”原来是你，是吗?” “Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards. “是的,”哈利说。他看着其他的男孩。他们两个都很胖，看起来很卑鄙。站在苍白的男孩两旁，他们看起来像保镖。 “Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. “And my name’s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” “哦，这是克拉布，这是高尔。”脸色苍白的男孩注意到哈利在看什么地方，漫不经心地说。“我叫马尔福，德拉科马尔福。” Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him. 罗恩轻轻地咳了一声，可能是在偷偷地笑。德拉科马尔福看着他。 “Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.” “你觉得我的名字好笑吗?”没必要问你是谁。我父亲告诉我韦斯莱家的人都长着红头发，长着雀斑，孩子多得买不起。 He turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.” 他转向哈利。“你很快就会发现有些巫师家庭比其他家庭好得多，波特。你不想和错误的人交朋友。我可以帮你。” He held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry didn’t take it. 他伸出手想和哈利握手，但哈利没有握。 “I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” he said coolly. “我想我自己能看出来谁不合适，谢谢，”他冷冷地说。 Draco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks. 德拉科马尔福没有脸红，但苍白的脸颊上出现了一丝粉红色。 “I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly. “Unless you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as your parents. They didn’t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.” “如果我是你，我会小心的，波特。”“除非你更有礼貌一点，否则你会和你父母走同样的路。”他们也不知道什么对他们有好处。你要是跟韦斯莱兄弟和那个海格这样的无赖混在一起，你会吃不消的。” Both Harry and Ron stood up. 哈利和罗恩都站了起来。 “Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair. “再说一遍，”罗恩说，他的脸和头发一样红。 “Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Malfoy sneered. “哦，你要和我们打架，是吗?”“马尔福冷笑道。 “Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron. “除非你现在出去。”哈利说，他比自己感觉的要勇敢得多，因为克拉布和高尔比他和罗恩大得多。 “But we don’t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We’ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.” “但是我们不喜欢离开，是吗，孩子们?”我们把所有的食物都吃完了，你好像还有些。 Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron — Ron leapt forward, but before he’d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell. 高尔伸手去摸罗恩旁边的巧克力青蛙——罗恩一跃而起，但还没碰到高尔，高尔就发出一声可怕的喊叫。 Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle’s knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they’d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in. 水鼠的斑斑挂在他的手指上，尖利的小牙齿深深地嵌进高尔的指关节里。高尔一边嚎叫着，一边把斑斑一圈一圈地甩过来，克拉布和马尔福往后退。也许他们以为糖果里藏着更多的老鼠，也许他们听到了脚步声，因为一秒钟后，赫敏·格兰杰走了进来。 “What has been going on?” she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail. “发生了什么事?”她说着，看着满地的糖果，罗恩抓着尾巴捡起斑斑。 “I think he’s been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. “No — I don’t believe it — he’s gone back to sleep.” “我想他是昏过去了。”罗恩对哈利说。他更仔细地看了看斑斑。“不——我不相信——他又睡着了。” And so he had. 他确实做到了。 “You’ve met Malfoy before?” “你以前见过马尔福吗?” Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley. 哈利解释了他们在对角巷的相遇。 “I’ve heard of his family,” said Ron darkly. “They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they’d been bewitched. My dad doesn’t believe it. He says Malfoy’s father didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.” He turned to Hermione. “Can we help you with something?” “我听说过他的家人。”“他们是神秘人消失后首批回到我们身边的人。说他们被施了魔法。我爸爸不相信。他说马尔福的父亲不需要任何借口就可以去黑暗面。他转向赫敏。“我们能帮你什么忙吗?” “You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we’re nearly there. You haven’t been fighting, have you? You’ll be in trouble before we even get there!” “你最好快点穿上长袍，我刚才到前面去问售票员，他说我们快到了。”你没有打架吧?我们还没到那儿你就有麻烦了!” “Scabbers has been fighting, not us,” said Ron, scowling at her. “Would you mind leaving while we change?” “斑斑打架了，不是我们。”罗恩说着，怒视着她。“我们换衣服时，你介意离开吗?” “All right — I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy voice. “And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?” “好吧——我进来只是因为外面的人很孩子气，在走廊里跑来跑去。”“顺便问一下，你鼻子上还有土，你知道吗?” Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down. 她离开时罗恩瞪着她。哈利凝视着窗外。天渐渐黑了。在深紫色的天空下，他可以看到群山和森林。火车似乎在减速。 He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron’s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them. 他和罗恩脱下夹克衫，穿上黑色长袍。罗恩的鞋对他来说有点短，你可以看到下面是他的运动鞋。 A voice echoed through the train: “We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes’ time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.” 火车上回荡着一个声音:“再过五分钟我们就要到达霍格沃茨了。”请把你的行李放在火车上，火车会把你的行李单独送到学校的。 Harry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor. 哈利的胃里充满了紧张，他看到罗恩的雀斑下一片苍白。他们把最后的糖果塞进口袋，加入了拥挤在走廊上的人群。 The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: “Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All right there, Harry?” 火车慢了下来，最后停了下来。人们挤向门口，来到一个又小又黑的平台上。哈利在寒冷的夜里瑟瑟发抖。这时，一盏灯在学生们头顶上摇曳着，哈利听到一个熟悉的声音:“第一学年!”这儿有好几年了!还好吧，哈利?” Hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. 海格毛茸茸的大脸在人山人海的上空闪闪发光。 “C’mon, follow me — any more firs’ years? Mind yer step, now! Firs’ years follow me!” “来吧，跟我来——还有几年吗?”注意脚下，现在!第一年岁跟我来!” Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice. 他们跌跌撞撞地跟在海格后面，沿着一条似乎又陡又窄的小路往下走。他们两边都很黑，哈利想那里一定有茂密的树。没有人说话。纳威，那个一直丢癞蛤蟆的男孩，闻了一两次。 “Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid called over his shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.” “你马上就能第一眼看到霍格沃茨了，”海格转过头来喊道，“就在这个拐弯处。” There was a loud “Oooooh!” 有一声“喔喔喔!” The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. 一条狭窄的小路突然通向一个黑色的大湖的边缘。在另一边的一座高山顶上，它的窗户在繁星点点的天空中闪闪发光，是一座有着许多塔楼和塔楼的巨大城堡。 “No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione. “一艘船上再也没有四个人了!”海格指着岸边的一队小船喊道。纳威和赫敏跟着哈利和罗恩上了船。 “Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. “Right then — FORWARD!” “每个人都在吗?海格喊道，他自己有一条船。“就在那时——向前!” And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. 一队小船立刻出发了，滑过像玻璃一样光滑的湖面。每个人都沉默着，凝望着头顶上的城堡。当他们航行越来越接近它所在的悬崖时，它高耸入云。 “Heads down!” yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles. “低头!当第一艘船到达悬崖时，海格喊道。他们都低下头来，小船载着他们穿过常春藤做成的帘子。他们被抬着沿着一条黑暗的隧道往前走，这条隧道似乎就在城堡下面，一直走到一个类似地下港口的地方，在那里他们爬上岩石和卵石。 “Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them. “哦,你在那里!这是你的蟾蜍吗?海格说，人们从船里爬出来时，他正在检查船。 “Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle. “特雷弗!纳威高兴地叫着，伸出双手。然后，他们跟在海格的灯后面，爬上岩石上的一条通道，最后走了出来，来到城堡阴影下光滑潮湿的草地上。 They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door. 他们走上一段石阶，挤在橡木大门的周围。 “Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?” “每个人都在这里吗?你在那儿，还有你的蟾蜍吗?” Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door. 海格举起一个巨大的拳头，在城堡的门上敲了三下。 J.K.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s StoneChapter Six The Journey from Platform Nine and Three-quartersHarry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first. On the last day of August he thought he’d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King’s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room. “Er — Uncle Vernon?” Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. “Er — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — to go to Hogwarts.” Uncle Vernon grunted again. “Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?” Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. “Thank you.” He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke. “Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?” Harry didn’t say anything. “Where is this school, anyway?” “I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket. “I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o’clock,” he read. His aunt and uncle stared. “Platform what?” “Nine and three-quarters.” “Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no platform nine and three-quarters.” “It’s on my ticket.” “Barking,” said Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of them. You’ll see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take you to King’s Cross. We’re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.” “Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly. “Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle Vernon. “Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.” Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want to walk into the station in his wizard’s robes — he’d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off. They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. “Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do they?” He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all. “Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He’d have to ask someone. He stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said there wasn’t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl. Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s stand between platforms nine and ten. At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying. “— packed with Muggles, of course—” Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry’s in front of him — and they had an owl. Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying. “Now, what’s the platform number?” said the boys’ mother. “Nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, “Mom, can’t I go⋯” “You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.” What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it — but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished. “Fred, you next,” the plump woman said. “I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy. “Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can’t you tell I’m George?” “Sorry, George, dear.” “Only joking, I am Fred,” said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone — but how had he done it? Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there — and then, quite suddenly, he wasn’t anywhere. There was nothing else for it. “Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman. “Hello, dear,” she said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s new, too.” She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose. “Yes,” said Harry. “The thing is — the thing is, I don’t know how to—” “How to get onto the platform?” she said kindly, and Harry nodded. “Not to worry,” she said. “All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into it, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.” “Er — okay,” said Harry. He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid. He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he’d be in trouble — leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn’t be able to stop — the cart was out of control — he was a foot away — he closed his eyes ready for the crash — It didn’t come⋯ he kept on running⋯ he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts’ Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it. Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks. The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.” “Oh, Neville,” he heard the old woman sigh. A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd. “Give us a look, Lee, go on.” The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg. Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot. “Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins he’d followed through the barrier. “Yes, please,” Harry panted. “Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!” With the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment. “Thanks,” said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes. “What’s that?” said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry’s lightning scar. “Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you — ?” “He is,” said the first twin. “Aren’t you?” he added to Harry. “What?” said Harry. “Harry Potter.” chorused the twins. “Oh, him,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am.” The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train’s open door. “Fred? George? Are you there?” “Coming, Mom.” With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train. Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief. “Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.” The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. “Mom — geroff” He wriggled free. “Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?” said one of the twins. “Shut up,” said Ron. “Where’s Percy?” said their mother. “He’s coming now.” The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it. “Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said. “I’m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves—” “Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. “You should have said something, we had no idea.” “Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,” said the other twin. “Once—” “Or twice—” “A minute—” “All summer—” “Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect. “How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one of the twins. “Because he’s a prefect,” said their mother fondly. “All right, dear, well, have a good term — send me an owl when you get there.” She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins. “Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up a toilet or—” “Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.” “Great idea though, thanks, Mom.” “It’s not funny. And look after Ron.” “Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.” “Shut up,” said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it. “Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?” Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him looking. “You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?” “Who?” “Harry Potter!” Harry heard the little girl’s voice. “Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please⋯” “You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn’t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?” “Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there — like lightning.” “Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.” “Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?” Their mother suddenly became very stern. “I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.” “All right, keep your hair on.” A whistle sounded. “Hurry up!” their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry. “Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.” “We’ll send you a Hogwarts’ toilet seat.” “George!” “Only joking, Mom.” The train began to move. Harry saw the boys’ mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved. Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn’t know what he was going to — but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind. The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in. “Anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. “Everywhere else is full.” Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn’t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose. “Hey, Ron.” The twins were back. “Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train — Lee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.” “Right,” mumbled Ron. “Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.” “Bye,” said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them. “Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out. Harry nodded. “Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George’s jokes,” said Ron. “And have you really got — you know⋯” He pointed at Harry’s forehead. Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared. “So that’s where You-Know-Who — ?” “Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.” “Nothing?” said Ron eagerly. “Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.” “Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again. “Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him. “Er — Yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mom’s got a second cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.” “So you must know loads of magic already.” The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about. “I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they like?” “Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.” “Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. “I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy’s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it’s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, and Percy’s old rat.” Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep. “His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff — I mean, I got Scabbers instead.” Ron’s ears went pink. He seemed to think he’d said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window. Harry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he’d never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up. “⋯ and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort—” Ron gasped. “What?” said Harry. “You said You-Know-Who’s name!” said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. “I’d have thought you, of all people—” “I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,” said Harry, “I just never knew you shouldn’t. See what I mean? I’ve got loads to learn⋯ I bet,” he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, “I bet I’m the worst in the class.” “You won’t be. There’s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.” While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past. Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, “Anything off the cart, dears?” Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron’s ears went pink again and he muttered that he’d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor. He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry — but the woman didn’t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat. “Hungry, are you?” “Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty. Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, “She always forgets I don’t like corned beef..” “Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a pasty. “Go on—” “You don’t want this, it’s all dry,” said Ron. “She hasn’t got much time,” he added quickly, “you know, with five of us.” “Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry’s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). “What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. “They’re not really frogs, are they?” He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him. “No,” said Ron. “But see what the card is. I’m missing Agrippa.” “What?” “Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect — famous witches and wizards. I’ve got about five hundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.” Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man’s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore. “So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry. “Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said Ron. “Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks—” Harry turned over his card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling. Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore’s face had disappeared. “He’s gone!” “Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said Ron. “He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again and I’ve got about six of her⋯ do you want it? You can start collecting.” Ron’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped. “Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.” “Do they? What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sounded amazed. “Weird!” Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the Druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans. “You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned Harry. “When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor — you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.” Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner. “Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.” They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper. The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked tearful. “Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?” When they shook their heads, he wailed, “I’ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!” “He’ll turn up,” said Harry. “Yes,” said the boy miserably. “Well, if you see him⋯” He left. “Don’t know why he’s so bothered,” said Ron. “If I’d brought a toad I’d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can’t talk.” The rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap. “He might have died and you wouldn’t know the difference,” said Ron in disgust. “I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn’t work. I’ll show you, look⋯” He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end. “Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway—” He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes. “Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,” she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth. “We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” said Ron, but the girl wasn’t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand. “Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.” She sat down. Ron looked taken aback. “Er — all right.” He cleared his throat. “Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.” He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep. “Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all worked for me. Nobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough — I’m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?” She said all this very fast. Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either. “I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered. “Harry Potter,” said Harry. “Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about you, of course — I got a few extra books, for background reading, and you’re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.” “Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed. “Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I could if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do either of you know what house you’ll be in? I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad⋯ Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.” And she left, taking the toadless boy with her. “Whatever house I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.” “What house are your brothers in?” asked Harry. “Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. “Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not. I don’t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.” “That’s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?” “Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed. “You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off houses. “So what do your oldest brothers do now that they’ve left, anyway?” Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he’d finished school. “Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,” said Ron. “Did you hear about Gringotts? It’s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don’t suppose you get that with the Muggles — someone tried to rob a high security vault.” Harry stared. “Really? What happened to them?” “Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t been caught. My dad says it must’ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don’t think they took anything, that’s what’s odd. ‘Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.” Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying “Voldemort” without worrying. “What’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked. “Er — I don’t know any.” Harry confessed. “What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s the best game in the world — ” And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he’d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time. Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley. “Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?” “Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards. “Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. “And my name’s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him. “Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.” He turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.” He held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry didn’t take it. “I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” he said coolly. Draco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks. “I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly. “Unless you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as your parents. They didn’t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.” Both Harry and Ron stood up. “Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair. “Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Malfoy sneered. “Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron. “But we don’t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We’ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.” Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron — Ron leapt forward, but before he’d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell. Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle’s knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they’d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in. “What has been going on?” she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail. “I think he’s been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. “No — I don’t believe it — he’s gone back to sleep.” And so he had. “You’ve met Malfoy before?” Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley. “I’ve heard of his family,” said Ron darkly. “They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they’d been bewitched. My dad doesn’t believe it. He says Malfoy’s father didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.” He turned to Hermione. “Can we help you with something?” “You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we’re nearly there. You haven’t been fighting, have you? You’ll be in trouble before we even get there!” “Scabbers has been fighting, not us,” said Ron, scowling at her. “Would you mind leaving while we change?” “All right — I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,” said Hermione in a sniffy voice. “And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?” Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down. He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron’s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them. A voice echoed through the train: “We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes’ time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.” Harry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor. The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: “Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All right there, Harry?” Hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. “C’mon, follow me — any more firs’ years? Mind yer step, now! Firs’ years follow me!” Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice. “Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid called over his shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.” There was a loud “Oooooh!” The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. “No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione. “Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. “Right then — FORWARD!” And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. “Heads down!” yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles. “Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them. “Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle. They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door. “Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?” Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door. J.K. Rowling Harry Potter &amp; The Sorcerer’s Stone]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s StoneChapter Four The Keeper of the Keys 第五章 对角巷 Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. 第二天早晨，哈利醒得很早。虽然他能看出天已经亮了，但他还是把眼睛闭得紧紧的。 “It was a dream, he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be at home in my cupboard.” 他坚定地告诉自己，这是一场梦。“我梦见一个叫海格的巨人来告诉我，我要去一所巫师学校。等我睁开眼睛，我就会在家里的碗柜里了。” There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. 突然有很大的敲击声。 And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream. “还有佩妮姨妈在敲门，”哈利想，心里一沉。但是他仍然没有睁开眼睛。这真是个好梦。 Tap. Tap. Tap. 啪、啪、啪。 “All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.” “好吧，”哈利喃喃地说，“我要起来了。” He sat up and Hagrid’s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak. 他坐起来，海格的厚大衣从他身上掉了下来。小屋充满了阳光，风暴已经过去，海格自己也在倒塌的沙发上睡着了，一只猫头鹰用爪子敲着窗户，嘴里叼着一张报纸。 Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’s coat. 哈利爬了起来，高兴得心里好像有个大气球在膨胀。他径直走到窗前，猛地打开窗户。猫头鹰飞了进来，把报纸掉在海格身上，海格没有醒过来。猫头鹰扑通一声落在地板上，开始攻击海格的外套。 “Don’t do that.” “不要那样做”。 Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat. 哈利想把猫头鹰从路上摇开，但猫头鹰猛地啄了他一下，继续撕咬他的大衣。 “Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl—” “海格!哈利大声说。“猫头鹰——“ “Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa. “给他钱。”海格咕哝着坐在沙发上。 “What?” “什么?” “He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the pockets.” “他要付送报纸的钱。看看口袋里。” Hagrid’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets — bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags⋯ finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. 哈利拿出一把奇怪的硬币。 “Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily. “给他五个纳特。”海格睡意朦胧地说。 “Knuts?” “克拉？” “The little bronze ones.” “小青铜人。” Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window. 哈利数出五枚小铜币，猫头鹰伸出腿来，让哈利把钱放进一个小皮包里。然后他从开着的窗户飞走了。 Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. 海格打了个呵欠，坐了起来，伸了个懒腰。 “Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.” “哈利，你最好快点准备好，今天有好多事要做，你得起来到伦敦去买你上学用的东西。” Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture. 哈利把巫师的硬币翻过来看着。他刚刚想到了一件事，使他觉得他内心的快乐的气球好像被戳破了。 “Um — Hagrid?” “嗯——海格?” “Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots. “嗯?海格一边说，一边穿上他的大靴子。 “I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last night⋯ he won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.” “我没有钱,你昨晚听到弗农姨父⋯他不会支付我去学习魔法。” “Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. “D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything?” “别担心，”海格说着站起来挠挠头。“你认为你父母没给你留下什么吗?” “But if their house was destroyed—” “但是如果他们的房子被毁了——” “They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a sausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.” “他们没有把金子放在房子里，孩子!”不，我们的第一站是古灵阁。巫师的银行。吃根香肠吧，他们不是重感冒——我也不会拒绝你的生日蛋糕。” “Wizards have banks ?” “巫师有银行?” “Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.” “就一个。古灵阁。由小妖精。” Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. 哈利把手里的那块香肠弄掉了。 “Goblins ?” “小妖精?” “Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe — ‘cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’ fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.” Hagrid drew himself up proudly. “He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin’ you — gettin’ things from Gringotts — knows he can trust me, see.” “是啊——我告诉你，要是你去抢，你会发疯的。”千万别惹妖精，哈利。古灵阁是世界上最安全的地方，无论你想要什么，它都是安全的——除了霍格沃茨。事实上，我还是要去古灵阁。邓布利多带。霍格沃茨的业务。海格自豪地站了起来。“他总是让我帮他做重要的事情。从古灵阁拿东西给你——他知道他可以信任我，明白吗?” “Got everythin’? Come on, then.” “有东西保存”?那么,来吧。” Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm. 哈利跟着海格走到岩石上。现在天空很晴朗，大海在阳光下闪闪发光。维能姨丈租来的船还在那儿，风暴过后，船底下还有很多水。 “How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around for another boat. “你怎么到这儿来的?”哈利问道，四处寻找另一条船。 “Flew,” said Hagrid. “飞,”海格说。 “Flew ?” “飞?” “Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve got yeh.” “是的——但是我们会回去的。”现在我抓住你了，不许你用魔法。” They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying. 他们在船上坐了下来，哈利仍然盯着海格，想象着他在飞。 “Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. “If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?” “不过，这也太丢人了。”海格说，又斜睨了哈利一眼。“如果我能再快一点，你不介意在霍格沃茨提一下吗?” “Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land. “当然不是。”哈利说，渴望看到更多的魔法。海格又拿出那把粉红色的伞，在船舷上敲了两下，然后他们飞快地向陆地驶去。 “Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked. “你为什么要发疯去抢古灵阁呢?””哈利问。 “Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. “They say there’s dragons guardin’ the high security vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.” “咒语——魔法。”海格一边说，一边打开报纸。“他们说有龙守卫着高度安全的金库。然后你得找到你的路——古灵阁在伦敦地下几百英里，明白吗?在地下深处。即使你设法弄到钱，你也会饿得要死的。” Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d never had so many questions in his life. 海格在看他的报纸《预言家日报》时，哈利坐在那里思考着这个问题。哈利从弗农姨父那里得知，人们在做这件事的时候喜欢一个人呆着，但这很难，他这辈子从来没有遇到过这么多问题。 “Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid muttered, turning the page. “魔法部又把事情搞砸了。”海格翻了一页，喃喃地说。 “There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could stop himself. “有魔法部吗?”哈利还没来得及阻止自己，就问道。 “’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin’ fer advice.” “当然,”海格说。“当然，他们想让邓布利多当牧师，但他永远不会离开霍格沃茨，所以老康奈利·福吉得到了那份工作。”如果有的话，那一定是个笨蛋。所以他每天早上都向邓布利多扔猫头鹰，征求意见。 “But what does a Ministry of Magic do ?” “但是魔法部做什么呢?” “Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.” “嗯，他们的主要工作是不让麻瓜们知道，全国上下还有巫师。” “Why?” “为什么?” “Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.” “为什么?天哪，哈利，每个人都想用魔法解决他们的问题。不，最好不要管我们。” At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street. 就在这时，船轻轻地撞在了港口的墙上。海格卷起报纸，他们爬上石阶，来到街上。 Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn’t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?” 过路的人在穿过小镇去车站的路上，目不转睛地盯着海格。哈利不能怪他们。海格的身高不仅是其他人的两倍，他还不停地指着一些非常普通的东西，比如停车计时器，大声地说:“哈利，看到了吗?”这些麻瓜梦想出来的东西，是吗?” “Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?” “海格，”哈利气喘吁吁地跑去追赶，“你是说古灵阁里有龙吗?” “Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a dragon.” “嗯，他们是这么说的。”“哎呀，我想要一条龙。” “You’d like one?” “你想要一个吗?” “Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.” “从我还是个孩子的时候就想要一个——这边走。” They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets. 他们已经到了车站。五分钟后有一班去伦敦的火车。海格不懂他所谓的“麻瓜的钱”，他把钞票给了哈利，这样他就可以买他们的票了。 People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent. 火车上的人比以往任何时候都目不转睛。海格占了两个座位，坐着编织一个看上去像金丝雀黄色的马戏团帐篷的东西。 “Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted stitches. “还收到你的信吗，哈利?”他边数针脚边问。 Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. 哈利从口袋里掏出羊皮纸信封。 “Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything yeh need.” “好,”海格说。“那儿有一张单子，上面列有你需要的一切。” Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t noticed the night before, and read: 哈利打开第二张纸，上面写着: HOGWARTS SCHOOL o f WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY 霍格沃茨魔法学校 UNIFORM 统一的 First-year students will require: 一年级学生需要: Three sets of plain work robes (black) 三套素色工作服(黑色) One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear 一顶普通的尖顶帽子(黑色)，白天戴 One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar) 3.一副防护手套(龙皮或类似) One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings) 一件冬衣(黑色，银色系扣) Please note that all pupils’ clothes should carry name tags 请注意所有学生的衣服都要有名牌 COURSE BOOKS 课程的书 All students should have a copy of each of the following: 所有学生应持有下列各项的副本: The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk 米兰达·戈肖克的《标准魔法书》(一年级) A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot 巴希达·巴沙特的《魔法史》 Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling 阿德阿尔伯特·华夫林的魔法理论 A Beginners’ Guide to Transfiguration by Emeric Switch 一个初学者的指南变形由Emeric开关 One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore 《一千个神奇的药草和真菌》作者:菲利达孢子 Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger 阿西尼厄斯·吉格尔的魔法草稿和药剂 Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander 纽特·斯卡曼的《神奇动物在哪里》 The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin Trimble 黑暗力量:昆汀·特林布尔的自我保护指南 OTHER EQUIPMENT 其他设备 1 wand 1魔杖 1 cauldron (pewter, standard size 2) 1个坩埚(白镴，标准尺寸2) 1 set of glass or crystal phials 一套玻璃或水晶小瓶 1 telescope set 1望远镜组 1 brass scales 1铜天平 Students may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad 学生也可以带猫头鹰、猫或蟾蜍 PARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS 家长们被提醒，一年级不允许有自己的扫帚 “Can we buy all this in London?” Harry wondered aloud. “我们能在伦敦买到这些东西吗?”哈利大声问道。 “If yeh know where to go,” said Hagrid. “如果你知道去哪儿，”海格说。 Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow. 哈里以前从未去过伦敦。虽然海格似乎知道他要去哪里，但他显然不习惯以一种普通的方式去那里。他被堵在地铁的检票口，大声抱怨座位太小，火车太慢。 “I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops. “我不知道麻瓜没有魔法是怎么生活的，”他一边说，一边爬上一台坏掉的自动扶梯，电梯通向一条熙熙攘攘、商店林立的街道。 Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting him. 海格个头很大，很容易就把人群分开了。哈利所要做的就是紧紧地跟在他后面。他们经过书店、音像店、汉堡店和电影院，但似乎没有一个地方能卖给你一根魔杖。这只是一条普通的街道，挤满了普通人。在他们脚下几英里的地方真的埋藏着成堆的巫师金币吗?真的有卖咒语书和扫帚的商店吗?这难道不是德思礼一家编造的一个大笑话吗?如果哈利不知道德思礼一家没有幽默感，他也许会这么想;然而，尽管海格到目前为止告诉他的一切都是难以置信的，哈利还是禁不住相信了他。 “This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky Cauldron. It’s a famous place.” “就是这个，”海格停了下来，“破釜酒吧。”这是一个著名的地方。 It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t pointed it out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn’t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside. 那是一家看上去脏兮兮的小酒馆。如果海格没有指出来，哈利就不会注意到它在那里。匆匆而过的人们没有看它一眼。他们的目光从一边的大书店移到另一边的唱片店，仿佛根本看不到破釜酒吧。事实上，哈利有一种奇特的感觉，只有他和海格能看见。他还没来得及说，海格就把他领了进去。 For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, Hagrid?” 作为一个著名的地方，它非常黑暗和破旧。几个老妇人坐在角落里，喝着小杯雪利酒。其中一个在抽烟斗。一个戴大礼帽的小个子男人正在和老调酒师说话。他们进来时，低低的谈话声停止了。似乎每个人都认识海格;他们朝他挥了挥手，笑了笑，酒保拿起一杯酒说:“还是老样子，海格?” “Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees buckle. “不行，汤姆，我在霍格沃茨上学。”海格说着，用他那只大手拍了拍哈利的肩膀，把哈利的膝盖扣得紧紧的。 “Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is this — can this be — ?” “天哪，”酒保盯着哈利说，“这是——这是——吗?” The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent. 破釜酒吧突然变得寂静无声。 “Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Potter⋯ what an honor.” 低声说:“上帝保佑我的灵魂旧酒保,“哈利波特⋯荣幸。” He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes. 他从酒吧后面急匆匆地走出来，冲向哈利，抓住他的手，眼里含着泪水。 “Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.” “欢迎回来，波特先生，欢迎回来。” Harry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming. 哈利不知道该说什么。每个人都在看着他。那个拿着烟斗的老妇人正在抽烟，却没有意识到烟斗已经熄灭了。海格是喜气洋洋的。 Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron. 接着，椅子上传来一阵刮擦声，接着，哈利发现自己在破釜酒吧里和每个人都握了手。 “Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.” “多丽丝·克罗克福德，波特先生，不敢相信我终于见到你了。” “So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.” “太骄傲了，波特先生，我真的太骄傲了。” “Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.” “我一直想和你握手——我浑身颤抖。” “Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus Diggle.” “很高兴，波特先生，只是不能告诉你，迪格尔的名字，迪达勒斯·迪格尔。” “I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in his excitement. “You bowed to me once in a shop.” “我以前见过你!”哈利说，迪达勒斯·狄格尔的大礼帽在兴奋中掉了下来。“你有一次在商店里向我鞠躬。” “He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. “Did you hear that? He remembers me!” Harry shook hands again and again — Doris Crockford kept coming back for more. “他还记得!迪达勒斯·狄格尔环顾四周，喊道。“你听到了吗?”他还记得我!哈利一次又一次地和她握手——多里斯。克劳福特老是跑回来想多握几次手。 A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching. 一个脸色苍白的年轻人非常紧张地向前走去。他的一只眼睛在抽搐。 “Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” “奇洛教授!”海格说。“哈利，奇洛教授将是你在霍格沃茨的老师之一。” “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.” “p-p -波特，”奇洛教授抓住哈利的手，结结巴巴地说，“c- t不能告诉你见到你我有多高兴。” “What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?” “你教什么魔法，奇洛教授?” “D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think about it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” He laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.” He looked terrified at the very thought. “黑魔法防御术，黑魔法防御术。”奇洛教授咕哝着说，好像他不愿意去想它似的。“不是说你不需要，是吧，p - p -波特?”他紧张地笑了。“我想你会把你所有的装备都带上吧?”我得去买一本关于吸血鬼的新书，我自己。他一想到这里就显得很害怕。 But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble. 但是其他人不让奇洛教授把哈利单独留下。几乎花了十分钟才摆脱他们。最后，海格终于使自己的声音从嘈杂声中传出来。 “Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.” “一定要去买——买很多。”来吧,哈利。” Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds. 多丽丝·克罗克福德最后一次握了握哈利的手，海格领着他们穿过酒吧，来到一个有围墙的小院子里，里面只有一个垃圾桶和几棵野草。 Hagrid grinned at Harry. 海格冲哈利咧嘴一笑。 “Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind you, he’s usually tremblin’.” “我告诉过你，是不是?”告诉你你很有名。即使奇洛教授见到你也在发抖——你要知道，他平时也是发抖的。” “Is he always that nervous?” “他总是那么紧张吗?” “Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin’ outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience⋯ They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject — now, where’s me umbrella?” “哦,是的。可怜的家伙。聪明的头脑。他很好,他是项研究“离开书然后他花了一年时间后得到一些第一手经验⋯他们说他遇到了吸血鬼的黑森林,和和一个非常危险难缠的老巫婆——从此以后一切就变样了——他开始害怕学生们，对自己的课题也感到惊恐——我的伞在哪？” Vampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can. 吸血鬼吗?女巫吗?哈利头晕目眩。与此同时，海格正在数垃圾桶上方墙上的砖头。 “Three up⋯ two across⋯ ” he muttered. “Right, stand back, Harry.” “三两跨⋯⋯”他咕哝着说。“好的，往后站，哈利。” He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella. 他用伞尖在墙上敲了三下。 The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight. 他碰过的那块砖在颤动——它在扭动——中间出现了一个小洞——越来越大了——一秒钟后，他们面对着一个拱门，大得连海格都够大了，那是一条通往鹅卵石街道的拱门，弯弯曲曲的，看不见了。 “Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.” “欢迎来到对角巷，”海格说。 He grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall. 他对哈利的惊讶咧嘴一笑。他们穿过拱门。哈利飞快地回头一看，只见拱门立刻缩进了坚固的墙里。 The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons — All Sizes — Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring — Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. 太阳明亮地照在最近的商店外面的一堆坩埚上。“各种大小的坩埚——铜的、黄铜的、锡的、银的——可自行搅拌的——可折叠的。” “Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money first.” “是的，你需要一个，”海格说，“但是我们得先把钱给你。” Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, “Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad⋯” 哈利希望他能再多8只眼睛。他们沿街而上时，他朝各个方向转了转脑袋，试图同时看一看所有的东西:商店，外面的东西，买东西的人。外一个丰满的女人一个药剂师通过摇着头,说,“龙肝,十七镰刀一盎司,他们疯狂⋯” A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. “Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever — ” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon⋯ 一间黑漆漆的店铺里传出低沉而柔和的叫声，招牌上写着“伊洛普猫头鹰商场”——黄褐色、尖声、谷仓、棕色和雪白。几个和哈利差不多大的男孩鼻子紧贴着一扇窗户，窗户上插着扫把。“看,”哈利听到其中一个说,“新的灵气二千——史上最快——“有商店出售的长袍,商店卖望远镜和奇怪的银仪器哈利从来没有见过,窗户堆满了桶蝙蝠脾脏和鳗鱼的眼睛,摇摇欲坠的成堆的法术书,鹅毛笔,和卷羊皮纸,药剂瓶,地球仪的月亮⋯ “Gringotts,” said Hagrid. “古灵阁,”海格说。 They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was — 他们来到一座雪白的建筑物前，它比其他小商店都高。站在那扇擦得锃亮的铜门旁边，穿着一套鲜红色和金色的制服的是—— “Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: “是的，那是个妖精。”他们走上白色的石阶，海格平静地说。妖精大约比哈利矮一头。他长着一张黝黑而机灵的脸，留着尖尖的胡子。哈利注意到，他的手指和脚都很长。他们走进来时，他鞠了一躬。现在他们正对着第二扇门，这次是银的，门上刻着字: Enter, stranger, but take heed 进来吧，陌生人，小心点 Of what awaits the sin of greed, 等待着贪婪之罪的， For those who take, but do not earn, 对于那些只索取而不赚钱的人， Must pay most dearly in their turn. 他们必须依次付出最大的代价。 So if you seek beneath our floors 所以如果你在我们的地板下寻找 A treasure that was never yours, 一个从未属于你的宝藏， Thief, you have been warned, beware 小偷，有人警告过你，当心 Of finding more than treasure there. 在那里发现的不仅仅是宝藏。 “Like I said, Yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Hagrid. “就像我说的，你要是去抢它，你会发疯的，”海格说。 A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter. 一对妖精把他们从银色的门里迎了出来，他们来到一个巨大的大理石大厅里。大约有一百多个妖精坐在一个长柜台后面的高脚凳上，在大账本上乱涂乱画，用黄铜天平称硬币，用眼镜检查宝石。大厅外面的门太多了，数不清有多少扇，但更多的妖精带着人们进进出出。海格和哈利朝柜台走去。 “Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” “早上好，”海格对一个自由的妖精说。“我们是来从哈利·波特先生的保险柜里拿钱的。” “You have his key, sir?” “你有他的钥匙吗，先生?” “Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin’s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals. “就在这的什么地方,”海格说。他开始把口袋里的东西全倒在柜台上，把一把发霉的狗饼干撒在妖精的《数字书》上。妖精皱了皱鼻子。哈利看着他们右边的妖精称着一堆和煤炭一样重的红宝石。 “Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. “明白了。”海格终于举起一把小金钥匙说。 The goblin looked at it closely. 妖精仔细地看着它。 “That seems to be in order.” “这似乎很合适。” “An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.” “我这儿还有一封邓布利多教授的信。”海格挺起胸膛，神气十足地说。“是关于713号金库里的那个神秘人的。” The goblin read the letter carefully. 妖精仔细地读着信。 “Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!” “很好，”他说着，把书还给海格，“我会派人把你带到两个地下室去。”拉环!” Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall. 拉环是另一个妖精。海格把所有的狗饼干塞回口袋后，他和哈利跟着拉环朝通向大厅的一扇门走去。 “What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?” Harry asked. “713号金库里的那个神秘人是什么?””哈利问。 “Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me. More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.” “我不能告诉你，”海格神秘地说。“很秘密。霍格沃茨的业务。邓布利多的信任我。告诉你就超出了我的职权范围。 Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty — and were off. 拉环帮他们把门打开。哈利本来以为会有更多的大理石，结果却吃了一惊。他们在一条用火把点着的狭窄的石头通道里。它向下倾斜得很陡，地上几乎没有铁路轨道。拉环吹了一声口哨，一辆小车沿着铁轨疾驰而来。他们爬了进去——海格费了好大劲——然后离开了。 At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn’t steering. 起初，他们只是在迷宫般曲折的通道中疾驰而过。哈利试着记住，左，右，右，左，中叉，右，左，但这是不可能的。那辆格格作响的车似乎知道自己该走哪条路，因为拉环没有掌舵。 Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. 冷空气从他们身边呼啸而过，哈利的眼睛刺痛了，但他还是睁得大大的。有一次，他以为在通道的尽头看到了一团火，他扭头想看看是不是龙，但是太晚了——他们往更深的地方冲去，经过一个地下湖，那里的天花板和地板上生长着巨大的钟乳石和石笋。 “I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?” “我不知道，”哈利隔着马车的声音对海格喊道，“石笋和钟乳石有什么区别?” “Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ ask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.” “石笋上有个‘m’字，”海格说。“现在别问我问题，我想我会生病的。” He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling. 他的脸色确实很苍白。当马车终于停在过道墙边的一扇小门旁边时，海格下了车，不得不靠在墙上，以免膝盖发抖。 Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts. 拉环打开了门。许多绿色的烟雾滚滚而来，当它消散的时候，哈利喘着粗气。里面是成堆的金币。列的银。成堆的青铜小疙瘩。 “All yours,” smiled Hagrid. “全是你的。”海格笑着说。 All Harry’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have known about this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London. 哈利的——真是难以置信。德思礼一家不可能知道这件事，否则他们从他那里得到消息的速度会比眨眼还快。他们有多少次抱怨哈利花了他们多少钱来养他?一直以来，他都有一笔小小的财产，埋在伦敦的地底下。 Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. 海格帮哈利往袋子里塞了一些。 “The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?” “那些金币是加隆的，”他解释说。“17个银镰刀对一艘大帆船，29个纳特对一把镰刀，这很容易。好吧，那应该足够几个月了，我们会把剩下的留给你。他转向拉环。“现在请跳713米，我们能再慢一点吗?” “One speed only,” said Griphook. “只有一种速度，”拉环说。 They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. 他们现在走得更深了，速度越来越快。他们在急转弯时，空气变得越来越冷。他们哗啦哗啦地跑过一个地下深谷，哈利侧过身去，想看看在黑洞洞的底部到底是什么东西，但海格呻吟了一声，抓住他的后颈把他拉了回来。 Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. 713号金库没有锁眼。 “Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. 拉环很重要地说:“往后站。”他用一根长长的手指轻轻地摸着门，门就融化了。 “If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,” said Griphook. 拉环说:“如果不是古灵阁的妖精干的，他们会被门吸进去，困在里面。” “How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Harry asked. “你多久检查一次里面有没有人?””哈利问 “About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a rather nasty grin. “大约每十年一次。”拉环说着，带着一种很不愉快的笑容。 Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least — but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask. 哈利确信，一定有什么特别的东西藏在这个最高的安全密室里。他急切地向前探了探身，希望至少能看到一些奇珍异宝——但起初他以为里面是空的。然后他注意到地板上有一个用牛皮纸包着的肮脏的小包裹。海格把它捡起来，塞进大衣里面。哈利渴望知道那是什么，但他知道最好不要问。 “Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to me on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid. “走吧，回到这地狱般的车里去，回来的时候别跟我说话，我最好闭上嘴巴。”海格说。 One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he’d had in his whole life — more money than even Dudley had ever had. 一次疯狂的马车旅行之后，他们站在古灵阁外面的阳光下眨着眼睛。哈利现在有了一个装满钱的袋子，他不知道先去哪儿跑。他不需要知道一磅等于多少加隆，就能知道他手里的钱比他一生中拥有的都多——比达德里还多。 “Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.” He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous. “还是去拿你的制服吧。”海格说着，朝马尔金夫人的长袍点了点头。“听着，哈利，你介意我去破釜酒吧喝一杯吗?”我讨厌古灵阁的手推车。他看起来还是有点不舒服，所以哈利一个人走进了马尔金夫人的商店，心里很紧张。 Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve. 马尔金夫人是一个矮胖的、面带微笑的女巫，穿着淡紫色的衣服。 “Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to speak. “Got the lot here — another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.” “霍格沃茨,亲爱的?当哈利开始说话时，她说。“这里有很多——事实上，刚才又有一个年轻人打扮起来了。” In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length. 在商店的后面，一个面色苍白、尖尖的男孩站在一个脚凳上，另一个女巫正把他的黑色长袍别起来。马尔金夫人让哈利站在旁边的凳子上，把一件长袍披在他头上，开始把它别到合适的长度。 “Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?” “你好，”男孩说，“霍格沃茨也是吗?” “Yes,” said Harry. “是的,”哈利说。 “My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s up the street looking at wands,” said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.” “我爸爸在隔壁买我的书，妈妈在街上看魔杖，”男孩说。他的声音沉闷而拖沓。“那我就把他们拖到赛车场去。”我不明白为什么第一年不能有自己的。我想我要威逼父亲给我买一个，然后偷偷地把它带进来。” Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. 哈利想起了达力。 “Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on. “你有自己的扫帚吗?”男孩继续说。 “No,” said Harry. “不,”哈利说。 “Play Quidditch at all?” “玩魁地奇吗?” “No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be. “不，”哈利又说，不知道魁地奇到底是什么。 “I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you’ll be in yet?” “我知道——爸爸说，如果我不被选去为我的房子踢球，那就是犯罪。我必须说，我同意。”你知道你会住在什么房子里吗?” “No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. “不，”哈利说，他觉得自己越来越笨了。 “Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?” “好吧，在他们到那儿之前没有人真正知道，是吗?但我知道我会在斯莱特林，我们全家都在——想象一下在赫奇帕奇，我想我会离开的，你说呢?” “Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting. “嗯，”哈利说，希望他能说些更有趣的东西。 “I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in. “我说，看那个人!”男孩突然朝前窗点点头说。海格站在那里，朝哈利咧嘴笑着，指着两个大冰淇淋，表示他进不去。 “That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t. “He works at Hogwarts.” “那是海格，”哈利说，很高兴知道了一些男孩不知道的事情。“他在霍格沃茨工作。” “Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?” “哦，”男孩说，“我听说过他。他是一种仆人，不是吗?” “He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second. “他是猎场看守人。”他越来越不喜欢这个男孩了。 “Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.” “是的,没错。我听说他有点野蛮——住在学校操场上的一间小屋里，时不时地喝醉，想变魔术，结果却把床点着了。” “I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly. “我认为他很聪明。”哈利冷冷地说。 “Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where are your parents?” “你?男孩说着，微微一笑。“他为什么和你在一起?”你的父母在哪里?” “They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the matter with this boy. “他们死了。”哈利简短地说。他不太想和这个男孩谈这件事。 “Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were our kind, weren’t they?” “哦，对不起，”另一个说，听起来一点也不难过。“但他们是我们的同类，不是吗?” “They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.” “他们是巫师，如果你是这个意思的话。” “I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?” “我真的认为他们不应该让另一类人进来，你说呢?”他们只是不一样，他们从来没有被带大知道我们的方式。想象一下，他们中的一些人在收到那封信之前甚至从未听说过霍格沃茨。我想他们应该把它留在古老的巫师家族。你到底姓什么?” But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool. 哈利还没来得及回答，马尔金夫人就说:“亲爱的，你说完了。”哈利不为不跟孩子说话找借口而感到抱歉，从脚凳上跳了下来。 “Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy. “好吧，我想我们在霍格沃茨见。”男孩慢吞吞地说。 Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts). 哈利吃着海格给他买的冰淇淋(巧克力、覆盆子和碎坚果)，一言不发。 “What’s up?” said Hagrid. “有什么事吗?”海格说。 “Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s Quidditch?” “没什么,”哈利撒了谎。他们停下来买羊皮纸和羽毛笔。哈利发现一瓶墨水在你写的时候颜色变了，他高兴了起来。他们离开商店后，他说:“海格，什么是魁地奇?” “Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — not knowin’ about Quidditch!” “天哪，哈利，我老是忘了你对魁地奇是多么的不了解啊!” “Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s. “别让我感觉更糟，”哈利说。他把马尔金夫人家那个苍白的男孩的事告诉了海格。 “— and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be allowed in—” “——他说麻瓜家庭的人甚至不应该被允许进来——” “Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh were — he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his parents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ‘em in a long line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!” “你不是麻瓜家族的。如果他知道你是谁——他长大后知道你的名字，如果他的父母是巫师的话。你看到破釜酒吧里的每个人看到你时的样子。不管怎么说，他知道些什么呢?我所见过的最好的巫师中，只有在长长的队伍里才有魔法——瞧你妈妈!看她有个妹妹!” “So what is Quidditch?” “那么什么是魁地奇呢?” “It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.” “这是我们的运动。巫师的运动。这就像——就像麻瓜世界里的足球——每个人都跟着魁地奇——骑着扫帚在空中玩，有四个球——有点难以解释规则。” “And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?” “斯莱特林和赫奇帕奇是什么?” “School houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but—” “学校的房子。有四种。大家都说赫奇帕奇是个笨蛋，可是——” “I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily. “我打赌我在赫奇帕奇。”哈利闷闷不乐地说。 “Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.” “赫奇帕奇比斯莱特林强。”海格阴郁地说。“在斯莱特林，没有一个巫师不是堕落的。人一样。” “Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?” “沃——对不起——神秘人在霍格沃茨?” “Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid. “很多年以前，”海格说。 They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian. 他们在一家名叫“繁荣与印迹”的商店里买了哈利的课本，书架上摆满了皮面铺路石般厚的书，一直堆到天花板;书籍大小如邮票，以丝绸为封面;充满奇特符号的书，还有一些根本没有符号的书。即使是从来没有读过书的达力，也会很想弄到这些书的。海格差点被维里迪安教授从诅咒和反诅咒(用最新的复仇手段迷惑你的朋友，迷惑你的敌人:脱发、双腿僵硬、舌头打结等等)中拉出哈利。 “I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.” “我正在想办法诅咒达力。” “I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,” said Hagrid. “An’ anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.” “我不是说这不是个好主意，但你不能在麻瓜的世界里使用魔法，除非是在非常特殊的情况下。”“不管怎么说，你还不能对他们中的任何一个诅咒起作用，在你达到那个水平之前，你需要更多的学习。” Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). 海格也不让哈利买一个纯金的坩埚(“你的单子上写的是锡制的”)，但他们有一套称量药剂成分的好秤和一个可折叠的黄铜望远镜。然后，他们去了药剂师那里，那里的味道非常迷人，足以弥补它那难闻的气味，那是一种由坏鸡蛋和腐烂的卷心菜混合而成的气味。一桶桶粘糊糊的东西放在地板上;一罐罐药草、干燥的树根和明亮的粉末排列在墙上;一束束羽毛、一串串尖牙和咆哮的爪子从天花板上垂下来。当海格向柜台后面的那个人要一些基本的药剂成分时，哈利自己检查了21加隆的银色独角兽角和闪闪发光的黑色小甲虫眼睛(一勺5个纳特)。 Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list again. 在药剂师外面，海格又看了一遍哈利的单子。 “Just yer wand left — A yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birthday present.” “只剩下那根魔杖了——对，我还没有给你买生日礼物。” Harry felt himself go red. 哈利觉得自己脸红了。 “You don’t have to—” “你不必——” “I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ I don’ like cats, they make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’ everythin’.” “我知道我不必这么做。告诉你，我去找你的动物。不是癞蛤蟆，癞蛤蟆几年前就不流行了，你会被嘲笑的——“我不喜欢”猫，它们让我打喷嚏。我去给你找只猫头鹰。所有的孩子都想要猫头鹰，它们非常有用，把你的邮件和‘所有东西’都带在身上。” Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn’t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. 二十分钟后，他们离开了伊洛普斯猫头鹰商场，那里一片漆黑，满是沙沙作响、闪烁着宝石般明亮的眼睛。哈利现在拿着一个大笼子，笼子里关着一只美丽的雪鸮，猫头鹰把头埋在翅膀下熟睡着。他结结巴巴地说了声谢谢，听起来就像奇洛教授说的那样。 “Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect you’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.” “别客气，”海格粗声粗气地说。“别指望德思礼一家会送你很多礼物。现在只有奥利凡德离开了——只有魔杖的地方，奥利凡德，你得有最好的魔杖。” A magic wand⋯ this was what Harry had been really looking forward to. 一根魔杖⋯这是哈利一直很期待。 The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. 最后一家商店又窄又破。门上剥落的金色字母上写着:奥利凡德:自公元前382年起就有精美魔杖的制造者。 A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic. 他们走进去时，商店深处的某个地方响起了叮当的铃声。那是一个很小的地方，除了海格坐着等的一把细长的椅子外，什么也没有。哈利有一种奇怪的感觉，仿佛进入了一个非常严格的图书室;他吞下了刚刚想到的许多新问题，转而看着整整齐齐堆在天花板上的成千上万个狭窄的盒子。不知什么原因，他的脖子后面刺痛了。这里的尘土和寂静似乎都被某种神秘的魔力刺痛了。 “Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair. “下午好，”一个柔和的声音说。哈利跳了下去。海格一定也跳了起来，因为有一声嘎吱嘎吱的巨响，他赶紧从那张细长的椅子上站了起来。 An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop. 一个老人站在他们面前，他那大大的、苍白的眼睛像月亮一样在商店的黑暗中闪闪发光。 “Hello,” said Harry awkwardly. “你好，”哈利尴尬地说。 “Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question. “You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.” “啊，是的，”那人说。“是的,是的。我以为很快就能见到你了。哈利波特。这不是一个问题。“你有你妈妈的眼睛。”就在昨天，她自己还在这里，买了第一根魔杖。十又四分之一英寸长，沙沙作响，是柳树做的。漂亮的魔术棒。” Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. 奥利凡德先生走近哈利。哈利希望他能眨眼。那双银色的眼睛有点吓人。 “Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.” “另一方面，你父亲喜欢用红木魔杖。11英寸。柔软。多一点力量，对变形很好。“好吧，我说你父亲喜欢它——当然，是魔杖选择了巫师。” Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes. 奥利凡德先生靠得那么近，他几乎和哈利面对面。哈利可以从那双朦胧的眼睛里看到自己的影子。 “And that’s where⋯” “这就是⋯” Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long, white finger. 奥利凡德先生用一根又长又白的手指碰了碰哈利额头上闪电般的伤疤。 “I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly. “Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands⋯ well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to do⋯” “很抱歉，我把魔杖卖了，”他轻声说。“Thirteen-and-a-half英寸。紫杉。强大的魔杖,非常强大,在坏人手中⋯嗯,如果我知道,魔杖是走向世界⋯” He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid. 他摇了摇头，然后发现了海格，哈利松了一口气。 “Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again⋯ Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?” “Rubeus !鲁伯·海格!很高兴再次见到你⋯橡树,16英寸,而柔韧的,不是吗?” “It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid. “是的，先生。”海格说。 “Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern. “棒极了，就是那根。”但我猜你被开除的时候他们把它撕成两半了?奥利凡德先生突然严厉地说。 “Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. “I’ve still got the pieces, though,” he added brightly. “呃——是的，他们说了，是的。”海格拖着脚说。“不过，我现在还留着那些碎片，”他欢快地补充道。 “But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander sharply. “但是你不用它们吗?”奥利凡德先生厉声说。 “Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. “噢，不，先生。”海格急忙说。哈利注意到他说话时紧紧地握着粉红色的伞。 “Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. “Well, now — Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?” “嗯，”奥利凡德先生说，用锐利的目光看着海格。“好吧，现在——波特先生。让我看看。他从口袋里掏出一根有银色记号的卷尺。“你的魔杖是哪只胳膊?” “Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry. “呃——好吧，我是右撇子。” “Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand.” “伸出你的胳膊。”就是这样。他从肩膀到手指，然后从手腕到手肘，从肩膀到地板，从膝盖到腋窝，再到头顶。他说:“奥利凡德魔杖都有一种强大的魔法物质的核心，波特先生。我们用独角兽的毛，凤凰的尾羽，还有龙的心弦。没有哪两根奥利凡德魔杖是一样的，就像没有哪两种独角兽、龙或凤凰是完全一样的。当然，用另一个巫师的魔杖，你永远也不会得到这么好的结果。” Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. 哈利突然意识到，在他鼻孔间测量的卷尺是自己测量的。奥利凡德先生在架子上飞来飞去，取下盒子。 “That will do,” he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. “Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.” “那就行了，”他说着，卷尺就在地板上缩成一堆。“好吧，波特先生。”试试这个。山毛榉和龙的心弦。9英寸。漂亮的和灵活的。拿去，挥一挥手。” Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once. 哈利拿起魔杖(觉得很傻)晃了晃，但奥利凡德先生几乎马上就从他手里夺了过来。 “Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try—” 枫木和凤凰羽毛。7英寸。很有弹性的。试试——” Harry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander. 哈利试了一下——但他刚举起魔杖，魔杖也被奥利凡德先生夺了回来。 “No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.” “不，不——这儿，乌木和独角兽的头发，八英寸半，有弹性。”继续，继续，试一试。” Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become. 哈利试过了。和尝试。他不知道奥利凡德先生在等什么。那堆试过的魔杖在细长的椅子上越放越高，但奥利凡德先生从架子上抽出的魔杖越多，他似乎就越高兴。 “Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll find the perfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination — holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.” “棘手的客户,是吗?别担心，我们会在这里的某个地方找到完美的搭配——我现在在想——是的，为什么不呢——不寻常的组合——冬青和凤凰羽毛，11英寸长，漂亮而柔软。” Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, “Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well⋯ how curious⋯ how very curious⋯” 哈利拿起魔杖。他的手指突然感到一阵温暖。他把魔杖举过头顶，在尘土飞扬的空气中嗖嗖地一扫而下，一串红色和金色的火花像烟花一样从魔杖的一端射出，把一串串跳动的光点投射到墙上。海格又喊又拍，奥利凡德先生喊道:“噢，太棒了!是的，的确，哦，很好。好吧,先⋯⋯怎么很好奇⋯”多么奇特啊 He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious⋯ curious⋯ 他把哈利的魔杖回笼子里,用牛皮纸,仍然喃喃自语,“好奇好奇的⋯⋯ “Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?” “对不起，”哈利说，“有什么奇怪的?” Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. 奥利凡德先生苍白地盯着哈利。 “I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.” “我记得我卖过的每根魔杖，波特先生。每一个魔杖。碰巧凤凰的尾羽在你的魔杖里，它又给了你一根羽毛——只有一根。真的很奇怪，当它的兄弟——为什么，它的兄弟给了你那个伤疤——你注定要得到这根魔杖的时候。” Harry swallowed. 哈里吞下。 “Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember⋯ I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter⋯ After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great.” “是的,thirteen-and-a-half英寸。紫杉。真奇怪这些事情是怎么发生的。魔杖选择向导,记得⋯我认为我们必须从你期待伟大的事情,波特先生⋯毕竟,神秘人做了伟大的事情——可怕的,是的,但伟大的。” Harry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop. 哈利颤抖。他不确定自己是否太喜欢奥利凡德先生。他花了七加隆金币买了他的魔杖，奥利凡德先生从他的店里鞠了一躬。 The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn’t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry’s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder. 下午晚些时候，哈利和海格沿着对角巷往回走，穿过墙，穿过破釜酒吧，这时已经空无一人了。他们在路上走着，哈利一句话也没说。他甚至没有注意到有多少人在地铁里呆呆地盯着他们，因为他们都带着那些滑稽形状的包裹，还有那只睡在笼子里、睡在哈利腿上的雪鸮。登上另一部自动扶梯，进入帕丁顿车站;哈利直到海格拍了拍他的肩膀才意识到他们在哪儿。 “Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he said. “在火车开之前，我还有时间吃点东西，”他说。 He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow. 他给哈里买了一个汉堡包，他们坐在塑料座位上吃。哈利不停地四处张望。不知怎么的，一切看起来都那么奇怪。 “You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid. “你没事吧，哈利?”“你很安静，”海格说。 Harry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the best birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words. 哈利不敢肯定他能解释清楚。他刚刚度过了他一生中最美好的生日——然而——他嚼着汉堡包，试图找到合适的词语。 “Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander⋯ but I don’t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m famous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-, sorry — I mean, the night my parents died.” “每个人都认为我很特别，”他最后说。“所有这些人在破釜酒吧,奇洛教授先生Ollivander⋯但我不知道任何关于魔法。他们怎么能期待伟大的事情呢?我出名了，我甚至不记得我出名是因为什么。我不知道Vol——对不起——我是说，我父母去世的那晚发生了什么。” Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. 海格靠在桌子对面。在狂野的胡须和眉毛后面，他带着非常亲切的微笑。 “Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, ‘smatter of fact.” “别担心，哈利。”你会学得很快的。每个人在霍格沃茨都是从头开始，你会没事的。只是yerself。我知道这很难。你被挑出来了，这总是很难的。不过你在霍格沃茨会过得很愉快的——我过去是这样的——现在还是这样，‘事实上。’ Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope. 海格扶哈利上了火车，准备把他送回德思礼家，然后递给他一个信封。 “Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, ” he said. “First o’ September — King’s Cross — it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll know where to find me⋯ See yeh soon, Harry.” “你这张去霍格沃茨的票，”他说。“9月1日——国王十字勋章——都在你的票上。与德思礼一家的任何问题,给我发一封你的猫头鹰,她会知道哪里能找到我⋯看到叶很快,哈利。” The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone. 火车开出了车站。哈利想一直看着海格，直到看不见他为止。他从座位上站起来，把鼻子贴在窗户上，眨了眨眼，海格就走了。 J.K.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s StoneChapter Five Diagon AlleyHarry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. “It was a dream, he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be at home in my cupboard.” There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream. Tap. Tap. Tap. “All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.” He sat up and Hagrid’s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak. Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’s coat. “Don’t do that.” Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat. “Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl—” “Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa. “What?” “He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the pockets.” Hagrid’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets — bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags⋯ finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. “Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily. “Knuts?” “The little bronze ones.” Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window. Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. “Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.” Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture. “Um — Hagrid?” “Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots. “I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last night⋯ he won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.” “Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. “D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything?” “But if their house was destroyed—” “They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a sausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.” “Wizards have banks ?” “Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.” Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. “Goblins ?” “Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe — ‘cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’ fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.” Hagrid drew himself up proudly. “He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin’ you — gettin’ things from Gringotts — knows he can trust me, see.” “Got everythin’? Come on, then.” Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm. “How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around for another boat. “Flew,” said Hagrid. “Flew ?” “Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve got yeh.” They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying. “Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. “If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?” “Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land. “Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked. “Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. “They say there’s dragons guardin’ the high security vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.” Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d never had so many questions in his life. “Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid muttered, turning the page. “There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could stop himself. “’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin’ fer advice.” “But what does a Ministry of Magic do ?” “Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.” “Why?” “Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.” At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street. Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn’t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?” “Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?” “Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a dragon.” “You’d like one?” “Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.” They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets. People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent. “Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. “Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything yeh need.” Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t noticed the night before, and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL o f WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY UNIFORM First-year students will require: Three sets of plain work robes (black) One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar) One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings) Please note that all pupils’ clothes should carry name tags COURSE BOOKS All students should have a copy of each of the following: The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling A Beginners’ Guide to Transfiguration by Emeric Switch One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin Trimble OTHER EQUIPMENT 1 wand 1 cauldron (pewter, standard size 2) 1 set of glass or crystal phials 1 telescope set 1 brass scales Students may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad PARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS “Can we buy all this in London?” Harry wondered aloud. “If yeh know where to go,” said Hagrid. Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow. “I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops. Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting him. “This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky Cauldron. It’s a famous place.” It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t pointed it out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn’t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside. For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, Hagrid?” “Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees buckle. “Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is this — can this be — ?” The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent. “Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Potter⋯ what an honor.” He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes. “Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.” Harry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming. Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron. “Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.” “So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.” “Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.” “Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus Diggle.” “I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in his excitement. “You bowed to me once in a shop.” “He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. “Did you hear that? He remembers me!” Harry shook hands again and again — Doris Crockford kept coming back for more. A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching. “Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.” “What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?” “D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think about it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” He laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.” He looked terrified at the very thought. But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble. “Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.” Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds. Hagrid grinned at Harry. “Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind you, he’s usually tremblin’.” “Is he always that nervous?” “Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin’ outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience⋯ They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject — now, where’s me umbrella?” Vampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can. “Three up⋯ two across⋯ ” he muttered. “Right, stand back, Harry.” He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella. The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight. “Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.” He grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall. The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons — All Sizes — Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring — Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. “Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money first.” Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, “Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad⋯” A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. “Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever — ” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon⋯ “Gringotts,” said Hagrid. They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was — “Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn. So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there. “Like I said, Yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Hagrid. A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter. “Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” “You have his key, sir?” “Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin’s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals. “Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. The goblin looked at it closely. “That seems to be in order.” “An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.” The goblin read the letter carefully. “Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!” Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall. “What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?” Harry asked. “Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me. More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.” Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty — and were off. At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn’t steering. Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. “I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?” “Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ ask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.” He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling. Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts. “All yours,” smiled Hagrid. All Harry’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have known about this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London. Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. “The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?” “One speed only,” said Griphook. They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. “Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. “If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,” said Griphook. “How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Harry asked. “About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a rather nasty grin. Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least — but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask. “Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to me on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid. One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he’d had in his whole life — more money than even Dudley had ever had. “Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.” He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous. Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve. “Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to speak. “Got the lot here — another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.” In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length. “Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?” “Yes,” said Harry. “My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s up the street looking at wands,” said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. “Then I’m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.” Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. “Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on. “No,” said Harry. “Play Quidditch at all?” “No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be. “I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you’ll be in yet?” “No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. “Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?” “Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting. “I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in. “That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t. “He works at Hogwarts.” “Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?” “He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second. “Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.” “I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly. “Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? Where are your parents?” “They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the matter with this boy. “Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they were our kind, weren’t they?” “They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.” “I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?” But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool. “Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling boy. Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts). “What’s up?” said Hagrid. “Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s Quidditch?” “Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — not knowin’ about Quidditch!” “Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s. “— and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be allowed in—” “Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh were — he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his parents are wizardin’ folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ‘em in a long line o’ Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!” “So what is Quidditch?” “It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules.” “And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?” “School houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but—” “I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily. “Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.” “Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?” “Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid. They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian. “I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.” “I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,” said Hagrid. “An’ anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.” Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list again. “Just yer wand left — A yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birthday present.” Harry felt himself go red. “You don’t have to—” “I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ I don’ like cats, they make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’ everythin’.” Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn’t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. “Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect you’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now — only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.” A magic wand⋯ this was what Harry had been really looking forward to. The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic. “Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair. An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop. “Hello,” said Harry awkwardly. “Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question. “You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.” Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. “Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it — it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.” Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes. “And that’s where⋯” Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long, white finger. “I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly. “Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands⋯ well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to do⋯” He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid. “Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again⋯ Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?” “It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid. “Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern. “Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. “I’ve still got the pieces, though,” he added brightly. “But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander sharply. “Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. “Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. “Well, now — Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?” “Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry. “Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand.” Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. “That will do,” he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. “Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.” Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once. “Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try—” Harry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander. “No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.” Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become. “Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll find the perfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination — holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.” Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, “Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well⋯ how curious⋯ how very curious⋯” He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious⋯ curious⋯ “Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?” Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. “I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.” Harry swallowed. “Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember⋯ I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter⋯ After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great.” Harry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop. The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn’t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry’s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder. “Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he said. He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow. “You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid. Harry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the best birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words. “Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander⋯ but I don’t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m famous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-, sorry — I mean, the night my parents died.” Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. “Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, ‘smatter of fact.” Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope. “Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, ” he said. “First o’ September — King’s Cross — it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll know where to find me⋯ See yeh soon, Harry.” The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone. J.K.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s StoneChapter Four The Keeper of the Keys 第四章 钥匙的保管者 BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. 又是一阵巨响。他们又敲了敲门。达德利猛地清醒。 “Where’s the cannon?” he said stupidly. “大炮在哪里?他愚蠢地说。 There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands - now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them. 他们身后传来一声巨响，维能姨丈跌跌撞撞地进了房间。他手里拿着一支步枪——现在他们知道他带来的又长又细的包裹里装的是什么了。 “Who’s there?” he shouted. “I warn you — I’m armed!” “谁在那里?”他喊道。“我警告你——我有武器!” There was a pause. Then — 停顿了一下。然后, SMASH! 粉碎! The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor. 门被重重地撞了一下，它猛地从铰链上掉了下来，发出震耳欲聋的撞击声，重重地落在地板上。 A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair. 一个巨人站在门口。他的脸几乎完全被浓密的长发和乱蓬蓬的胡子遮住了，但你能看出来他的眼睛，像黑色甲虫一样在所有的头发下闪闪发光。 The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all. 巨人挤进了小屋，弯下腰，头刚好碰到了天花板。他弯下腰，拾起那扇门，轻而易举地把它装回门框里。外面的暴风雨声减弱了一点。他转过身来看着他们。 “Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not been an easy journey⋯” “你不能给我们沏杯茶吗?”这不是一条简单的旅程⋯” He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear. 他大步走到沙发前，达力吓得呆呆地坐在那里。 “Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger. “挪一挪，你这个大块头，”陌生人说。 Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. 达力尖叫着跑到妈妈身后躲起来，妈妈吓得蹲在维能姨丈后面。 “An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant. “一个‘这是哈里!巨人说。 Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. 哈利抬头看着那张凶狠、狂野、阴暗的脸，发现那双甲虫般的眼睛在微笑。 “Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the giant. “Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mom’s eyes.” “上次我见到你时，你还只是个孩子。”巨人说。“你长得很像你爸爸，但你有你妈妈的眼睛。” Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. 弗农姨父发出一种奇怪的刺耳的声音。 “I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You are breaking and entering!” “我要求你马上离开，先生!””他说。“你在破门而入!” “Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room. “啊，闭嘴，德思礼，你这大李子干，”巨人说;他从沙发后面探出身去，从弗农姨父手里夺过枪，像橡胶做的那样很容易地把它打了个结，扔到房间的一个角落里。 Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on. 弗农姨父又发出一种奇怪的声音，就像一只老鼠被人踩了一样。 “Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at some point, but it’ll taste all right.” “不管怎样——哈利，”巨人转过身去，对德思礼一家说，“祝你生日快乐。这儿有东西给你——我可能在什么时候坐在上面，不过味道会好的。” From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing. 他从黑色大衣的内口袋里掏出一个压扁了的盒子。哈利用颤抖的手指把它打开。里面是一个又大又粘的巧克力蛋糕，上面用绿色糖衣写着“哈利生日快乐”。 Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?” 哈利抬头看着巨人。他本想说声谢谢，但话到嘴边又说不出来了，他说的是:“你是谁?” The giant chuckled. 巨人笑了。 “True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.” 是的，我还没有介绍我自己。鲁伯·海格，霍格沃茨的钥匙和场地管理员。 He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm. 他伸出一只巨大的手，握住哈利的整只胳膊。 “What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands together. “I’d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.” “那么茶呢，嗯?”他搓着手说。“记住，如果你有的话，我不会说没有比这更强壮的了。” His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn’t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he’d sunk into a hot bath. 他的眼睛落在空空如也的炉排上，炉排里装着干瘪的薯片袋，他哼了一声。他在壁炉前弯下腰来;他们看不清他在干什么，但当他一秒钟后后退时，那里燃起了熊熊大火。它使整个潮湿的小屋充满了闪烁的灯光，哈利感到暖意袭上全身，仿佛他掉进了一个热水澡里。 The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.” 巨人在沙发上坐了下来,电线垂挂在他的体重,并开始把各种各样的东西从他的上衣口袋里的:铜水壶,柔软的包的香肠,扑克,一个茶壶,几个芯片杯子,一瓶琥珀色的液体,他从以前开始泡茶喝了一大口。很快，小屋就充满了嘶嘶作响的香肠的声音和气味。巨人干活的时候，谁也没吭声，可是当他把前六根又肥又多汁、微微烧焦了的香肠从火钳上滑下来的时候，达力有点坐立不安。维能姨丈严厉地说:“达力，他给你的东西你都不要碰。” The giant chuckled darkly. 巨人暗笑着。 “Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’ worry.” “德思礼，你这个好儿子再也不需要养肥了，别担心。” He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.” 他把香肠递给哈利，哈利饿极了，从来没有吃过这么好吃的东西，但他的目光始终无法离开巨人。最后，似乎没有人要解释什么，他说:“对不起，但我仍然不知道你是谁。” The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. 巨人喝了一大口茶，用手背擦了擦嘴。 “Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An’ like I told yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, o’ course. “叫我海格吧，”他说，“每个人都叫我海格。就像我告诉过你的，我是霍格沃茨的钥匙保管员——你当然会知道霍格沃茨的一切。 “Er — no,” said Harry. “呃——不，”哈利说。 Hagrid looked shocked. 海格看起来震惊。 “Sorry,” Harry said quickly. “对不起，”哈利急忙说。 “Sorry ?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. “It’s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren’t gettin’ yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even know abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?” “什么?”海格咆哮着，转身盯着德思礼一家。“应该道歉的是他们!”我知道你不会收到你的信，但我从没想过你会不知道霍格沃茨，哪怕是大声哭出来!你从没想过你父母是从哪儿学来的吗?” “All what?” asked Harry. “什么?”哈利问。 “ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus’ one second!” “什么?”海格大声疾呼。“现在等一等!” He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall. 他跳了起来。在他的愤怒中，他似乎充满了整个小屋。德思礼一家蜷缩在墙边。 “Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Dursleys, “that this boy — this boy! — knows nothin’ abou’ — about ANYTHING?” “你的意思是告诉我，”他对德思礼一家咆哮道，“这个男孩——这个男孩!”——什么都不知道——什么都不知道?” Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren’t bad. 哈利觉得这有点过分了。他毕竟上过学，成绩也不错。 “I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do math and stuff.” “我知道一些事情，”他说。“你知道，我可以做数学之类的事情。” But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents’ world.” 但是海格只是挥了挥手说:“关于我们的世界，我是说。你的世界。我的世界。你的父母的世界。” “What world?” “什么世界?” Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode. 海格看上去好像要爆炸了。 “DURSLEY!” he boomed. “德思礼！”他怒吼道。 Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid stared wildly at Harry. 维能姨丈脸色苍白，低声说了句“米姆布温布尔”之类的话。海格疯狂地盯着哈利。 “But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he said. “I mean, they’re famous. You’re famous.” “但是你必须了解你的父母，”他说。我是说，他们很有名。你出名。” “What? My — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were they?” “什么?我的爸爸妈妈不是很有名，对吧?” “Yeh don’ know⋯ yeh don’ know⋯ ” Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare. “你不知道……你居然不知道……”海格跑他的手指通过他的头发,修复与不解地瞪着哈利。 “Yeh don’ know what yeh are ?” he said finally. “你不知道你是谁？”他最后问。 Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice. 弗农姨父突然开口说话了。 “Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!” “停!”他吩咐。“停在那儿，先生!”我不许你告诉那个男孩任何事情!” A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage. 一个比弗农姨父更勇敢的人，在海格现在怒视他的目光下也会退缩的;海格说话时，每一个音节都因愤怒而颤抖。 “You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it from him all these years?” “你从没告诉过他?”从没告诉他邓布利多留给他的信里写了什么?我在那里!我看见邓布利多把它留下了，德思礼!这些年来你一直瞒着他吗?” “Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly. “瞒着我什么?”哈利急切地说。 “STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. “停!我警告你!弗农姨父惊恐地喊道。 Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. 佩妮姨妈吓了一跳。 “Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry — yer a wizard.” “啊，你们通通给我去死吧。”“哈利——你是个巫师。” There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard. 屋里一片寂静。只能听到大海和呼啸的风声。 “I’m a what ?” gasped Harry. “我是什么?” “A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ a thumpin’ good ‘un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read yer letter.” “当然是个巫师，”海格说着，又坐回沙发上，沙发呻吟着，往下陷得更深了。有你这样的爸爸妈妈，你还能做什么?我想该是你读那封信的时候了。 Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read: 哈利终于伸手去拿那只淡黄色的信封，上面用翠绿的字体写着“海边岩石小屋地板上的哈利·波特先生”。他抽出信来读道: HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY 霍格沃茨魔法学校 Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE 校长:阿不思·邓布利多 (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards) (梅林订单，头等舱，大Sorc。,瑞士法郎。术士，至尊穆瓜普，国际忏悔。向导) Dear Mr. Potter, 亲爱的波特先生, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. 我们很高兴地通知您，您已经被霍格沃茨魔法学校录取了。随信附上所需书籍和设备的清单，请查收。 Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. 学期从九月一日开始。我们最迟在7月31日等候您的猫头鹰。 Yours sincerely, 你的真诚, Minerva McGonagall, 密涅瓦麦格教授, Deputy Headmistress 副校长 Questions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks and he couldn’t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, “What does it mean, they await my owl?” 哈利脑子里的问题像烟花一样炸开了花，他无法决定先问哪个。几分钟后，他结结巴巴地说:“他们在等我的猫头鹰，这是什么意思?” “Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: “我差点把’飞侠’哥根斯给忘了。”哈格力一边说，一边在自己额头上猛拍了一下，那力气足足可以把一辆马车掀翻。他用舌头咬着牙，潦草地写了一张纸条，哈利可以倒过来看: Dear Professor Dumbledore, 亲爱的邓布利多教授, Given Harry his letter. 把信给哈利。 Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. 明天带他去买东西。 Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well. 天气很可怕。希望你是好。 Hagrid 海格 Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone. 海格把纸条卷起来，递给猫头鹰，猫头鹰用嘴叼着它，走到门口，把猫头鹰扔进了暴风雨中。然后他回来坐了下来，好像这和打电话一样平常。 Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly. 哈利意识到自己的嘴张着，很快就闭上了。 “Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight. “我在什么地方?海格说，但就在这时，维能姨丈仍然面无血色，但看上去很生气，他走到火光里。 “He’s not going,” he said. “他不去，”他说 Hagrid grunted. 海格哼了一声。 “I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he said. “我想看到一个像你这样的大麻瓜阻止他，”他说。 “A what?” said Harry, interested. “什么?哈利感兴趣地说。 “A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it’s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.” “一个麻瓜，”海格说，“就是我们所说的像他们这样的没有魔法的人。你在一个我所见过的最大的麻瓜的家庭里长大，真倒霉。” “We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!” 弗农姨父说:“我们在收留他的时候就发誓要把那些垃圾消灭掉。”确实向导!” “You knew ?” said Harry. “You knew I’m a — a wizard?” “你知道吗?”“你知道我是一个——一个巫师?” “Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that — that school — and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was — a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!” “知道!佩妮姨妈突然尖叫起来。“知道!我们当然知道!你怎么可能不是，我那讨厌的妹妹?哦，她收到了一封这样的信，然后就消失了，去了那个学校——那个学校——每个假期回家时，她的口袋里都装满了蛙卵，把茶杯变成了老鼠。我是唯一一个看到她的人——一个怪胎!但是对我的父母来说，哦，不，是莉莉这个，莉莉那个，他们为家里有个女巫而自豪!” She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years. 她停下来深吸了一口气，然后继续咆哮。她似乎多年来一直想把这一切说出来。 “Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you’d be just the same, just as strange, just as — as — abnormal — and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!” “接着她在学校里遇到了波特，他们双双离开并且结了婚，然后有了你。当然我知道你会跟她一样，一样的古怪，一样的异常。再然后，她把自己炸死了，我们只好收养了你！” Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, “Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!” 哈利脸色发白了。他一开口就说:“炸死的?”你告诉我他们死于车祸!” “CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. “How could a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter? It’s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin’ his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!” “车祸!海格吼道，气得跳了起来，德思礼一家都跑回了他们的角落。“车祸怎么会害死莉莉和詹姆斯·波特呢?”这是一个愤怒!丑闻!哈利波特不知道他自己的故事，因为我们世界上的每个孩子都知道他的名字!” “But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently. “但为什么?发生了什么事?哈利急切地问。 The anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked suddenly anxious. 海格脸上的怒气消失了。他看上去突然焦急起来。 “I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried voice. “I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much yeh didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right person ter tell yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.” “我从没想过会这样，”他用低沉而焦虑的声音说。“我不知道，当邓布利多告诉我要抓住你可能会有麻烦的时候，你不知道有多少。”啊，哈利，我不知道我是不是告诉你的合适人选——但总得有人告诉你——你不能不知道就去霍格沃茨。” He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. 他恶狠狠地看了德思礼一家一眼。 “Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — mind, I can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, parts of it⋯” “我将把所有我知道的事都告诉你了，但是记住，我不可能告诉你所有事。这是一个很大的秘密，其中有一部分……” He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, “It begins, I suppose, with — with a person called — but it’s incredible yeh don’t know his name, everyone in our world knows—” 他坐下来，盯着炉火看了几秒钟，然后说:“我想，它是从一个叫……的人开始的——你不知道他的名字，这太不可思议了，我们世界上的每个人都知道——” “Who?” “谁?” “Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No one does.” “好吧——如果我能帮得上忙，我不喜欢提这个名字。没有人。” “Why not?” “为什么不?” “Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went⋯ bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was⋯” “吞下滴水嘴，哈利，人们还是很害怕。”天啊，这很难。看,有这个向导⋯坏了。尽你所能的坏。更糟。比更糟。他的名字叫⋯” Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. 海格咽了一口气，但一句话也说不出来。 “Could you write it down?” Harry suggested. “你能写下来吗?””哈利建议。 “Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort.” Hagrid shuddered. “Don’ make me say it again. Anyway, this — this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin’ fer followers. Got ‘em, too — some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o’ his power, ‘cause he was gettin’ himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches⋯ terrible things happened. He was takin’ over. ‘Course, some stood up to him — an’ he killed ‘em. Horribly. One o’ the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn’t dare try takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway. “不——不会拼写。”好吧，伏地魔。”海格战栗。“别让我再说一遍。”不管怎样，这个巫师，大约20年前，开始寻找追随者。他当然找到了——有些是害怕他，有些是想得到一些他的力量，因为他可以赋予别人能量。哈利，那些日子真是太可怕了。你不知道谁可以信任，不敢同陌生的巫师过于亲近……可怕的事情发生了。他统治了整个世界，当然有人站起来反抗他——他把他们都杀了。太恐怖了，霍格瓦彻成了唯一一个安全的地方，丹伯多则是’那个人’唯一害怕的人。但是那时几乎没有人敢去那所学校。” “Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an’ girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst’ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get ‘em on his side before⋯ probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side. “现在，你们的妈妈和爸爸是我所知道的最好的巫师。他们当时是霍格瓦彻的领袖人物! 可是’那个人’从来没有停止去说服他们加入他的行列……可能他知道他们与丹伯多太接近了，所以无法与黑暗势力沾上边。 “Maybe he thought he could persuade ‘em⋯ maybe he just wanted ‘em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an’ — an’—” “可能他认为不能说服他们……可能他只是想除掉他们。人们所知道的是，十年前的万圣节，他突然出现在你们住的村庄里，那时你只有一岁。他到了你家，接着，接着……” Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn. 海格突然掏出一块又脏又脏的手帕，像雾角一样擤了擤鼻子。 “Sorry,” he said. “But it’s that sad — knew yer mum an’ dad, an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find — anyway⋯ “对不起,”他说。“但这是难过,知道你的妈妈的爸爸,一个更好的人是找不到,总之⋯ “You-Know-Who killed ‘em. An’ then — an’ this is the real myst’ry of the thing — he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ‘em, no one except you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witches an’ wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you lived.” “那个人’把他们杀了。接着，奇怪的事情发生了——他也想杀了你的。我想他是为了斩草除根吧，或者他只是喜欢杀人。但是他杀不了你。难道你从来没有怀疑过你是怎样得到额头上那块疤痕的吗？那不是一道普通的疤痕，那是一个强大的邪恶的咒语施到你身上时你得到的——它可以保护你的父母和你们的房子。咒语在你身上根本没有起作用，这就是你为什么出名的原因了，哈利。如果他想杀哪个人，那个人一定活不下来，但是你例外。他杀掉了当时最好的几个巫师——麦基伦夫妇，波恩夫妇，普理韦兹夫妇——而你不过是一个婴儿，但是你居然活下来了。” Something very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. As Hagrid’s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before — and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh. 哈利的脑海里出现了一件非常痛苦的事情。当海格的故事接近尾声时，他又一次看到了那道耀眼的绿光，比他以前记忆中任何时候都要清晰——他还记起了一件事，这是他有生以来第一次记起:一阵又高又冷又残忍的笑声。 Hagrid was watching him sadly. 海格悲伤地看着他。 “Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot⋯” “我听从邓布利多的命令，亲自把你从那座破房子里救了出来。并把你送到这个地方……” “Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched. “胡说八道。”弗农姨父说。哈利跳;他几乎忘了德思礼一家在那儿。弗农姨父似乎恢复了勇气。他怒视着海格，攥紧了拳头。 “Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept there’s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdoes, no denying it, and the world’s better off without them in my opinion — asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just what I expected, always knew they’d come to a sticky end—” “现在,你听,孩子,”他咆哮道,“我承认你的确有些与众不同，毕竟我们要承认你赢了那场战斗。至于你的父母，你不必否认他们是怪人。在我眼中，没有了他们这世界会更加美好——他们做过些什么？不过都是些稀奇古怪的事情——正如我所料，我就知道他们不会有好下场——“ But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, “I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one more word⋯” 但就在这时，海格从沙发上跳了起来，从大衣里抽出一把破旧的粉红色雨伞。这指向弗农姨父像一把刀,他说,“我警告你，弗农——我警告你，你再说一个字的话……” In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent. 弗农姨父又一次失去了勇气，因为他有被一个长着胡子的巨人戳到伞尖的危险。他伏在墙上，一言不发。 “That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor. “这样好多了。”海格喘着粗气说，又坐回沙发上。 Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them. 与此同时，哈利还有数百个问题要问。 “But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You-Know-Who?” “可是沃——对不起——我是说，那个神秘人怎么了?” “Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see⋯ he was gettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d he go? “好问题,哈利。消失了。消失了。就在那天晚上他想杀了你。让你更出名。这是最大的迷雾之岛’ry,看到⋯他捞到的更多的是“更强大——他为什么要走? “Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’ believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of ‘em came outta kinda trances. Don’ reckon they could’ve done if he was comin’ back. 有的人说他已经死了。在我看来，他才不会像常人那么轻易地死掉。有的人说他还活着，只是藏起来了，我也不相信。原来在他那边的人回到我们这世界来了。他们中的许多人还做了不少好事。可是很难说如果他回来，他们还会不会继续做好人。 “Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. ‘Cause somethin’ about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on — I dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ about you stumped him, all right.” “我们大多数人都认为他还活着，只是失去了力量。太虚弱而无法继续。因为你身上的某些东西毁了他，哈利。那天晚上发生了一件他没有预料到的事——我不知道是什么事，没有人知道——但你身上的某种东西难倒了他，好吧。” Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He’d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn’t they been turned into warty toads every time they’d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football? 海格带着温暖和尊敬的目光望着哈利，哈利非但没有感到高兴和自豪，反而觉得肯定弄错了。一个巫师吗?他吗?他怎么可能呢?他一生都被达德里欺负，被佩妮姨妈和维能姨丈欺负;如果他真的是个巫师，为什么每次他们想把他锁在柜子里的时候，他们都没有变成癞蛤蟆呢?如果他曾经打败过世界上最伟大的魔法师，为什么达力总是能像踢足球一样踢他呢? “Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard.” “海格，”他平静地说，“我想你一定弄错了。我想我不能成为一个巫师。” To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. 令他吃惊的是，海格咯咯地笑了。 “Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?” “不是巫师，是吗?”当你害怕或生气的时候从来没有让事情发生过?” Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it⋯ every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry⋯ chased by Dudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach⋯ dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow back⋯ and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him? 哈利向火里望去。现在他来到想想⋯每个奇怪,曾经让他的叔叔和婶婶愤怒发生时,哈利,一直难过或生气⋯追赶达德利的帮派,他不知怎么发现自己的达到⋯害怕上学,可笑的发型,他设法让它长出来⋯和达德利最后一次击中了他,没有他的报复,甚至没有意识到他在做吗?他不是放了一条大蟒蛇在他身上吗? Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him. 哈利微笑着回头看了看海格，发现海格也在冲着他笑。 “See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.” “看到了吗?”海格说。“哈利·波特，不是巫师——你等等，你马上就会在霍格沃茨出名的。” But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight. 但是弗农姨父不会不战而降的。 “Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “He’s going to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish — spell books and wands and—” “我不是告诉过你他不去了吗?””他咬牙切齿地说。“他要去石墙高中，他会为此而感激的。”我读过那些信，他需要各种各样的垃圾——咒语书和魔杖，还有——” “If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop him,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name’s been down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won’t know himself. He’ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled—” “如果他想去，像你这样的大麻瓜是阻止不了他的。”“阻止莉莉和詹姆斯·波特的儿子去霍格沃茨!”你疯了。他的名字从出生起就被人遗忘了。他去了世界上最好的魔法学校。在那儿呆了七年，他都不认识自己了。他将和他自己的孩子们在一起，换换口味，他将在霍格沃茨有史以来最伟大的校长阿不思的手下——” “I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Vernon. “我才不花钱让一个老疯子教他魔术呢!”弗农姨父喊道。 But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, “NEVER — ” he thundered, ” — INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!” 他显然是做得太过分了。海格抓起伞，在头上打着旋，“从来没有——”他怒吼道，“侮辱——阿不思——邓布利多——在我面前——在我面前!” He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his trousers. 他把伞在空中嗖嗖地放下来，指着达德里——一道紫光闪了一下，发出像爆竹一样的声音，接着是一声尖锐的尖叫声。当他转过身去背对着他们时，哈利看见一条卷曲的猪尾巴从裤子上的一个洞里伸了出来。 Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them. 弗农姨父怒吼。他把佩妮姨妈和达力拖进另一个房间，最后惊恐地看了海格一眼，砰地一声关上了门。 Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard. 海格低头看着伞，抚摩着胡子。 “Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it didn’t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do.” “你不该对我发脾气，”他懊丧地说，“可不管怎样也没用。他的意思是要把他变成一头猪，但我想他太像一头猪了，反正也没什么可做的了。 He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows. 他从浓密的眉毛下斜睨了哈利一眼。 “Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,” he said. “I’m — er — not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff — one o’ the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job.” “如果你没有对霍格沃茨的任何人提起这件事，那就谢天谢地吧，”他说。“严格地说，我——呃——不应该施魔法。我被允许跟着你做一些事情，给你写一些信什么的——这也是我如此渴望接受这份工作的原因之一。” “Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry. “你为什么不应该施魔法?””哈利问。 “Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er — got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an’ everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.” “哦，好吧——我自己也在霍格沃茨上学，可是——呃——我被开除了，跟你说实话。”在我第三年。他们把我的魔杖一劈两半。但是邓布利多让我继续当猎场看守人。伟人,邓布利多。” “Why were you expelled?” “你为什么被开除了?” “It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” said Hagrid loudly. “Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an’ that.” “天晚了，我们明天还有很多事要做，”海格大声说。“我得上城里去，把你所有的书都拿来。” He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry. 他脱下厚厚的黑外套扔给哈利。 “You can kip under that,” he said. “Don’ mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o’ doormice in one o’ the pockets.” “你可以睡在那下面，”他说。“不介意它扭来扭去，我想我的口袋里还是有几只冬眠的睡鼠。” J.K.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s StoneChapter Four The Keeper of the KeysBOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. “Where’s the cannon?” he said stupidly. There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands - now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them. “Who’s there?” he shouted. “I warn you — I’m armed!” There was a pause. Then — SMASH! The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor. A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair. The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all. “Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not been an easy journey⋯” He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear. “Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger. Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. “An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant. Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. “Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the giant. “Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mom’s eyes.” Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. “I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You are breaking and entering!” “Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room. Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on. “Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at some point, but it’ll taste all right.” From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing. Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?” The giant chuckled. “True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.” He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm. “What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands together. “I’d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.” His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn’t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he’d sunk into a hot bath. The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.” The giant chuckled darkly. “Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’ worry.” He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.” The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An’ like I told yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, o’ course. “Er — no,” said Harry. Hagrid looked shocked. “Sorry,” Harry said quickly. “Sorry ?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. “It’s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren’t gettin’ yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even know abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?” “All what?” asked Harry. “ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus’ one second!” He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall. “Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Dursleys, “that this boy — this boy! — knows nothin’ abou’ — about ANYTHING?” Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren’t bad. “I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do math and stuff.” But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents’ world.” “What world?” Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode. “DURSLEY!” he boomed. Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid stared wildly at Harry. “But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he said. “I mean, they’re famous. You’re famous.” “What? My — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were they?” “Yeh don’ know⋯ yeh don’ know⋯ ” Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare. “Yeh don’ know what yeh are ?” he said finally. Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice. “Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!” A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage. “You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it from him all these years?” “Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly. “STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. “Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry — yer a wizard.” There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard. “I’m a what ?” gasped Harry. “A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ a thumpin’ good ‘un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read yer letter.” Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards) Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress Questions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks and he couldn’t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, “What does it mean, they await my owl?” “Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry his letter. Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well. Hagrid Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone. Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly. “Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight. “He’s not going,” he said. Hagrid grunted. “I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he said. “A what?” said Harry, interested. “A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it’s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.” “We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!” “You knew ?” said Harry. “You knew I’m a — a wizard?” “Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that — that school — and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was — a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!” She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years. “Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you’d be just the same, just as strange, just as — as — abnormal — and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!” Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, “Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!” “CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. “How could a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter? It’s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin’ his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!” “But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently. The anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked suddenly anxious. “I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried voice. “I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much yeh didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right person ter tell yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.” He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. “Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — mind, I can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, parts of it⋯” He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, “It begins, I suppose, with — with a person called — but it’s incredible yeh don’t know his name, everyone in our world knows—” “Who?” “Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No one does.” “Why not?” “Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went⋯ bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was⋯” Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. “Could you write it down?” Harry suggested. “Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort.” Hagrid shuddered. “Don’ make me say it again. Anyway, this — this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin’ fer followers. Got ‘em, too — some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o’ his power, ‘cause he was gettin’ himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches⋯ terrible things happened. He was takin’ over. ‘Course, some stood up to him — an’ he killed ‘em. Horribly. One o’ the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn’t dare try takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway. “Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an’ girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst’ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get ‘em on his side before⋯ probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side. “Maybe he thought he could persuade ‘em⋯ maybe he just wanted ‘em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an’ — an’—” Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn. “Sorry,” he said. “But it’s that sad — knew yer mum an’ dad, an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find — anyway⋯ “You-Know-Who killed ‘em. An’ then — an’ this is the real myst’ry of the thing — he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ‘em, no one except you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witches an’ wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you lived.” Something very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. As Hagrid’s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before — and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh. Hagrid was watching him sadly. “Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot⋯” “Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched. “Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept there’s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdoes, no denying it, and the world’s better off without them in my opinion — asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just what I expected, always knew they’d come to a sticky end—” But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, “I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one more word⋯” In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent. “That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor. Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them. “But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You-Know-Who?” “Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see⋯ he was gettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d he go? “Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’ believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of ‘em came outta kinda trances. Don’ reckon they could’ve done if he was comin’ back. “Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. ‘Cause somethin’ about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on — I dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ about you stumped him, all right.” Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He’d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn’t they been turned into warty toads every time they’d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football? “Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard.” To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. “Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?” Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it⋯ every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry⋯ chased by Dudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach⋯ dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow back⋯ and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him? Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him. “See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.” But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight. “Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “He’s going to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish — spell books and wands and—” “If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop him,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name’s been down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won’t know himself. He’ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled—” “I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Vernon. But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, “NEVER — ” he thundered, ” — INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!” He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his trousers. Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them. Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard. “Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it didn’t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do.” He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows. “Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,” he said. “I’m — er — not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff — one o’ the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job.” “Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry. “Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er — got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an’ everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.” “Why were you expelled?” “It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” said Hagrid loudly. “Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an’ that.” He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry. “You can kip under that,” he said. “Don’ mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o’ doormice in one o’ the pockets.” J.K.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s Stone 《哈利波特与魔法石》Chapter Three Letters from No One 第三章 无人来信 The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches. 那只巴西莽蛇的逃跑害得哈利受到有史以来最严厉的惩罚。到他被允许从柜子里出来的时候，暑假已经开始了。这时达德里已经弄坏了他的电影摄像机和遥控飞机，并且第一次骑赛车就把正拄着拐杖横穿马路的费格太太撞倒了。 Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting. 哈利很高兴学校放学了，但他还是逃不掉达德里一伙人，他们每天都来这所房子。皮尔斯、丹尼斯、马尔科姆和戈登都是又大又笨的，但达德利是他们当中最大最笨的，所以他是领头的。其余的人都很高兴参加达德里最喜欢的运动:哈利打猎。 This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny. 这就是为什么哈利尽可能多地呆在屋外，四处游荡，想着假期的结束，在那里他能看到一线希望。到了九月，他就要去上中学了，这是他有生以来第一次没有和达德里在一起。达德里被弗农姨父的旧私立学校斯梅廷小学录取了。皮尔斯·波基斯也去了。另一方面，哈里要去石墙中学，当地的公立学校。达力觉得这很有趣。 “They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,” he told Harry. “Want to come upstairs and practice?” “在石墙中学，他们第一天就把人的头塞进马桶里，”他告诉哈利。“想上楼来练习吗?” “No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had anything as horrible as your head down it — it might be sick.” Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he’d said. “不，谢谢。”“这个可怜的厕所从来没有像你的头朝下那么可怕的东西——它可能生病了。”达力还没弄明白他说了些什么，他就跑了。 One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg’s. Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as usual. It turned out she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several years. 七月的一天，帕尤妮亚姨妈带着达德里去伦敦买斯梅廷的校服，把哈利留在了费格太太家。费格太太不像往常那么坏。原来她被一只猫绊倒摔断了腿，看起来不像以前那么喜欢它们了。她让哈利看电视，还给了他一块巧克力蛋糕，尝起来好像她吃了好几年似的。 That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings’ boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life. 那天晚上，达力穿着崭新的制服在客厅里走来走去。斯梅廷的孩子们穿着栗色的燕尾服，橙色的灯笼裤，戴着一顶扁平的草帽，叫做“水手”。他们还拿着多节的棍子，在老师们不注意的时候用来打对方。这应该是对以后生活的良好训练。 As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn’t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh. 弗农姨父看着穿着新灯心裤的达力，粗声粗气地说，这是他一生中最自豪的时刻。佩妮姨妈突然哭了起来，说她简直不敢相信这是她的小弟弟，他看起来那么英俊，那么成熟。哈利不相信自己会说话。他想他的两根肋骨可能已经断了，因为他试图忍住不笑。 There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water. 第二天早晨，哈利走进厨房吃早饭时，厨房里有一股难闻的气味。它似乎是从水池里的一个大金属浴缸里发出来的。他去看了看。浴缸里装满了看起来像脏衣服的东西，在灰色的水里游泳。 “What’s this?” he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question. “这是什么?他问佩妮姨妈。如果他敢问问题，她的嘴唇就会像往常一样抿得紧紧的。 “Your new school uniform,” she said. “你的新校服，”她说。 Harry looked in the bowl again. 哈利又往碗里看了看。 “Oh,” he said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.” “哦，”他说，“我不知道它必须这么湿。” “Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing some of Dudley’s old things gray for you. It’ll look just like everyone else’s when I’ve finished.” “别傻了，”佩妮姨妈厉声说。“我把达德里的一些旧衣服染成灰色送给你。当我完成的时候，它看起来和其他人的一样。” Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High — like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably. 哈利很怀疑这一点，但他认为最好不要争论。他在桌边坐下，尽量不去想他在石墙高中的第一天会是什么样子——也许，就像他穿着大象的旧皮一样。 Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry’s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table. 达力和维能姨丈走了进来，他们俩都皱着鼻子，因为哈利的新制服散发出的气味。维能姨丈像往常一样打开报纸，达德里则把随身携带的那根棍子重重地放在桌子上。 They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat. 他们听到信箱的咔嗒声和信件在门垫上的哗啦声。 “Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. “去拿信来，达德里。”弗农姨父从报纸后面说。 “Make Harry get it.” “让哈利去拿。” “Get the mail, Harry.” “去拿信，哈利。” “Make Dudley get it.” “让达力去拿。” “Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.” “用你的棍子戳他，达力。” Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry. 哈利躲开那根棍子，去拿信。门垫上放着三样东西:一张弗农姨父的妹妹玛姬寄来的明信片，她正在怀特岛度假，一个棕色的信封，看上去像一张钞票，还有一封给哈利的信。 Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: 哈利把它捡起来，盯着它看，他的心像一根巨大的橡皮筋一样怦怦直跳。在他的一生中，从来没有人给他写过信。谁会?他没有朋友，没有其他亲戚——他不属于图书馆，所以他甚至从来没有收到过要求归还书籍的粗鲁纸条。可是这封信明明白白地写着: Mr. H. Potter h·波特先生 The Cupboard under the Stairs 楼梯下的碗柜 4 Privet Drive 女贞路4号 Little Whinging 小惠金区 Surrey 萨里 The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. 信封又厚又重，是用黄羊皮纸做的，地址是用墨绿色墨水写的。没有邮票。 Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H. 哈利把信封翻过来，手在颤抖，看到一个紫色的蜡封，上面印着一件盾徽。一只狮子，一只老鹰，一只獾和一条蛇围绕着一个大大的字母H。 “Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. “What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?” He chuckled at his own joke. “快点,男孩!弗农姨父在厨房里喊道。“你在干什么，检查信件炸弹吗?”听到自己的笑话，他笑了。 Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope. 哈利回到厨房，仍然盯着他的信。他把账单和明信片递给维能姨丈，坐下来，慢慢地打开黄色信封。 Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard. 弗农姨父撕开钞票，厌恶地哼了一声，把明信片翻过来。 “Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny whelk⋯” “玛吉病了，”他告诉佩妮姨妈。“吃了一个有趣的青春痘⋯” “Dad!” said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry’s got something!” “爸爸!” 达力突然说。“爸爸，哈利有东西!” Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon. 哈利正要把写在和信封一样厚的羊皮纸上的信拆开，维能姨丈猛地从他手里夺了过来。 “That’s mine!” said Harry, trying to snatch it back. “那是我的!” 哈利说，想把它夺回来。 “Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge. “谁会写信给你?”弗农姨父冷笑着说，一边用一只手把信抖开，瞥了一眼。他的脸从红变绿的速度比一组红绿灯还要快。而且还不止于此。几秒钟之内，粥就变成了灰白色。 “P-P-Petunia!” he gasped. “P-P-佩妮 !”他气喘吁吁地说。 Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise. 达德里想把信拿过来读，可是维能姨丈把信举得高高的，他够不着。佩妮姨妈好奇地接过信，读了第一行。有那么一会儿，她似乎要晕倒了。她掐住喉咙，发出令人窒息的声音。 “Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!” “弗农!哦，天哪——弗农!” They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn’t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick. 他们面面相觑，似乎忘了哈利和达力还在房间里。达力不习惯被忽视。他用手杖在他父亲的头上狠狠地敲了一下。 “I want to read that letter,” he said loudly. “我想读那封信，”他大声说。 “I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine.” “我想看，”哈利愤怒地说，“因为它是我的。” “Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope. “你们两个都出去，”弗农姨父尖叫着，把信塞回信封里。 Harry didn’t move. 哈利没有动。 “I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted. “我要我的信!””他喊道。 “Let me see it!” demanded Dudley. “让我看看!”达德利要求到。 “OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor. “出去!”弗农姨父吼道。他一把抓住哈利和达力的脖子，把他们扔进了大厅，砰的一声关上了厨房的门。哈利和达力立刻展开了一场激烈而又无声的争吵，谁在锁眼旁听他们说话。达力赢了，于是哈利一只耳朵上的眼镜晃来晃去，趴在地上，听着门和地板之间的裂缝。 “Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, “look at the address — how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don’t think they’re watching the house?” “弗农，”佩妮姨妈用颤抖的声音说，“看看这个地址——他们怎么可能知道他睡在哪儿呢?”你不认为他们在看房子吗?” “Watching — spying — might be following us,” muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. “监视——监视——可能在跟踪我们。”弗农姨父发疯似地嘀咕着。 “But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don’t want—” “可是我们该怎么办呢，弗农?”我们应该回信吗?告诉他们我们不想——” Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen. 哈利可以看到弗农姨父闪亮的黑色鞋子在厨房里踱来踱去。 “No,” he said finally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t get an answer⋯ Yes, that’s best⋯ we won’t do anything⋯” “不，”他最后说。“不，我们不管它。”如果他们得不到一个答案⋯是的,最佳⋯我们不会做任何⋯” “But—” “但——” “I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we swear when we took him in we’d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?” “我家里没有，佩妮!”我们不是发过誓，在收留他的时候，一定要把那些危险的胡言乱语消灭掉吗?” That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he’d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard. 那天晚上，弗农姨父下班回来，做了一件他以前从未做过的事;他到碗柜里看望哈利。 “Where’s my letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. “Who’s writing to me?” “我的信在哪里?弗农姨父一进门，哈利就问。“谁在给我写信?” “No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said Uncle Vernon shortly. “I have burned it.” “没有人。“这封信是错寄给你的，”弗农姨父简短地说。“我把它烧了。” “It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my cupboard on it.” “这不是一个错误，”哈利生气地说，“上面有我的碗柜。” “SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful. “沉默!”弗农姨父喊道，两只蜘蛛从天花板上掉了下来。他做了几次深呼吸，然后勉强地笑了笑，笑得很痛苦。 “Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking⋯ you’re really getting a bit big for it⋯ we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley’s second bedroom. “呃——是的，哈利——是关于这个碗柜的。”你姑姑和我一直思考⋯你真的有点大⋯我们认为它可能是好的如果你搬进了达德利的次卧室。 “Why?” said Harry. “为什么?”哈利说。 “Don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this stuff upstairs, now.” “别问问题!他叔叔厉声说道。“现在把这东西拿到楼上去。” The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor’s dog; in the corner was Dudley’s first-ever television set, which he’d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they’d never been touched. 德思礼家一共有四间卧室:一间是给弗农姨父和佩妮姨妈住的，一间是给客人住的(通常是弗农姨父的妹妹玛姬)，一间是达德里睡觉的地方，另一间是给达德里放第一间卧室放不下的玩具和其他东西的地方。哈利只上了一趟楼，就把他所有的东西从碗柜搬到了这个房间。他坐在床上，环顾四周。这里几乎所有的东西都坏了。一个月大的摄像机放在一辆小型工作坦克的顶部，这辆坦克是达德里曾经从邻居家的狗身上开过去的;角落里放着达德里的第一台电视机，那是他最喜欢的节目被取消时，他把脚伸进去的;有一个很大的鸟笼，里面曾经有一只鹦鹉，是达德里在学校用它换来的，是一支真正的气枪。其他书架上摆满了书。它们是房间里唯一看起来好像从未被碰过的东西。 From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don’t want him in there⋯ I need that room⋯ make him get out⋯” 来自楼下的声音达德利嚎啕大哭起来,他的母亲,我不希望他房间⋯⋯我需要让他出去⋯” Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he’d have given anything to be up here. Today he’d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it. 哈利叹了口气，躺在床上。昨天他会不惜一切代价来这里。今天他宁愿拿着那封信回到他的碗柜里，也不愿没有它就在上面。 Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly. 第二天早饭时，大家都很安静。达力惊呆了。他尖叫，用他的棍子打他的父亲，故意生病，踢他的母亲，把他的乌龟扔进温室的屋顶，但他仍然没有得到他的房间。哈利在想昨天的这个时候，恨不得在门厅里把信打开。维能姨丈和帕尤妮亚姨妈一直阴沉地对视着。 When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, “There’s another one! ‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive — ‘” 当邮件寄到的时候，弗农姨父似乎在尽力对哈利好，他让达德里去取信。他们一路听到他在大厅里用他的棍子敲打东西。然后他喊道:“还有一个!”“先生。波特，最小的卧室，女贞路4号” With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in his hand. 弗农姨父哽咽着叫了一声，从座位上跳起来，朝大厅跑去，哈利就在他身后。维能姨丈不得不把达德里摔倒在地，才从他手里拿到信。哈利从背后搂住了维能姨丈的脖子，这让事情变得很困难。经过一分钟混乱的打斗，弗农姨父直起腰来，上气不接下气，手里紧紧攥着哈利的信。 “Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” he wheezed at Harry. “Dudley — go — just go.” “去你的碗柜——我是说，你的卧室。”“达力，快走，快走。” Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first letter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this time he’d make sure they didn’t fail. He had a plan. 哈利在他的新房间里走来走去。有人知道他已经搬出了他的碗柜，他们似乎知道他还没有收到他的第一封信。这肯定意味着他们会再试一次吗?这次他要确保他们不会失败。他有一个计划。 The repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn’t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights. 第二天早上六点，修好的闹钟响了。哈利迅速地把它关掉，一声不响地穿好衣服。他不能吵醒德思礼一家。他没开灯就偷偷地下了楼。 He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door — 他打算在女贞路的拐角处等邮递员，先去取4号的信。当他蹑手蹑脚地穿过黑暗的大厅朝前门走去时，他的心怦怦直跳 “AAAAARRRGH!” “噢!” Harry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat — something alive! 哈利跳到了空中;他踩到了门垫上一个又大又软的东西——一个活着的东西! Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink. 楼上的灯亮了，哈利惊恐地意识到那个又大又软的东西原来是他叔叔的脸。维能姨丈一直躺在前门的一个睡袋里，显然是在确保哈利没有做他一直想做的事。他对哈利大喊了大约半个小时，然后叫他去泡杯茶。哈利痛苦地拖着步子走进厨房，等他回来时，信已经到了，正好落在弗农姨父的膝盖上。哈利看见三个用绿色墨水写的信。 “I want — ” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes. “我想——”他开始说，可是维能姨丈正当着他的面把信撕成碎片。 Uncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot. 弗农姨父那天没有去上班。他呆在家里钉好了邮筒。 “See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver them they’ll just give up.” “看，”他咬着一口指甲对佩妮姨妈解释说，“如果他们不能送的话，他们就会放弃的。” “I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.” “我不确定这能行，弗农。” “Oh, these people’s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. “哦，这些人的思维方式很奇怪，佩妮，他们不像你我，”弗农姨父说，试图用佩妮姨妈给他带来的水果蛋糕把钉子敲进去。 On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn’t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom. 星期五，至少有12封给哈利的信到了。由于无法通过邮箱插槽，他们被推到门下，从侧边开了条缝，有几个甚至被挤进了楼下浴室的小窗户。 Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” as he worked, and jumped at small noises. 弗农姨父又呆在家里了。烧完所有的信后，他拿出锤子和钉子，用木板封住前门和后门的裂缝，这样就没人能出去了。他一边工作，一边哼着“踮着脚尖穿过郁金香”，听到一些小声音就吓了一跳。 On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor. 周六，事情开始失控。二十四封给哈利的信进了屋子，卷起来藏在送牛奶的人从客厅窗户递给佩妮姨妈的二十多个鸡蛋里。弗农姨父怒气冲冲地给邮局和牛奶场打了一通电话，想找人投诉，佩妮姨妈却把信扔进了食品加工机里。 “Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” Dudley asked Harry in amazement. “到底有谁这么想跟你说话?”达力惊奇地问哈利。 On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. 星期天早上，维能姨丈坐在早餐桌旁，看上去很累，病得很重，但很高兴。 “No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, “no damn letters today—” “星期天不寄信，”他一面在报纸上涂果酱，一面愉快地提醒他们，“今天没有该死的信——” Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one — 他说话的时候，厨房的烟囱里有什么东西嗖的一声掉了下来，狠狠地砸在他的后脑勺上。不一会儿，三四十封信像子弹一样从壁炉里喷了出来。德思礼一家闪身一闪，哈利却跳到了空中，想抓住一只 “Out! OUT!” “出去!出来!” Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor. 弗农姨父一把抓住哈利的腰，把他扔进了大厅。佩妮姨妈和达德里双手捂着脸跑了出去，维能姨丈砰的一声把门关上。他们可以听到信还在源源不断地流入房间，在墙壁和地板上弹来弹去。 “That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. “I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!” “行了。”弗农姨父说，试图平静地说话，但同时从胡子上扯下了一绺又一绺的胡子。“我要你们五分钟后回到这里，准备离开。”我们要走了。打包一些衣服。没有参数!” He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag. 他的胡子少了一半，看上去很危险，没人敢跟他争辩。十分钟后，他们从被木板封住的门里钻了出来，钻进汽车，向高速公路疾驰而去。达力在后座抽着鼻子;他的父亲打了他的头，因为他在试图把电视、录像机和电脑装进运动包时把它们拿了起来。 They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. 他们开车。他们开车。甚至佩妮姨妈也不敢问他们要去哪里。弗农姨父不时会急转弯，朝相反的方向开一会儿车。 “Shake ‘em off⋯ shake ‘em off,” he would mutter whenever he did this. “摆脱他们⋯动摇他们,“他会抱怨当他这样做 They didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He’d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he’d missed five television programs he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer. 他们没有停下来吃或喝一整天。到了晚上，达力开始嚎叫。他这辈子从来没有过这么糟糕的一天。他饥肠辘辘，错过了五部他想看的电视节目，而且他从来没有这么长时间不炸毁电脑上的外星人。 Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering⋯ 弗农姨父终于在一个大城市郊区一家看上去很忧郁的旅馆外面停了下来。达力和哈利同住一个房间，有两张单人床，潮湿发霉的床单。达德利打鼾,但哈利保持清醒,坐在窗台上,俯视过往汽车的灯光,知道⋯ They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table. 第二天的早餐，他们吃了不新鲜的玉米片和冷罐头西红柿吐司。他们刚吃完，旅馆老板就来到他们的桌旁。 “’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an ‘undred of these at the front desk.” “‘对不起，你们是哈利·波特先生吗?’只有我在前台拿到了大约一百个。” She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: 她举起一封信，让他们看一下绿墨水写的地址: Mr. H. Potter h·波特先生 Room 17 房间17 Railview Hotel 铁路风景旅馆 Cokeworth 叩可文斯 Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared. 哈利伸手去拿信，但弗农姨父把他的手碰开了。女人盯着。 “I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room. “我买了，”弗农姨父说着，迅速站起身来，跟着她走出饭厅。 “Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage. “亲爱的，回家不是更好吗?”几个小时后，佩妮姨妈胆怯地建议道，但维能姨丈似乎没听见。他到底在找什么，他们谁也不知道。他把他们开进森林中央，下了车，环顾四周，摇了摇头，又回到车里，然后他们又上路了。同样的事情也发生在一片耕地的中央，一座悬索桥的中间，以及一座多层停车场的顶层。 “Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared. “爸爸疯了，不是吗?”那天下午达力迟钝地问佩妮姨妈。弗农姨父把车停在海边，把他们都锁在车里，然后就消失了。 It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled. 开始下雨了。大滴大滴的雨点打在车顶上。达德利啜泣。 “It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great Humberto’s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.” “今天是星期一，”他告诉妈妈。“伟大的温贝托今晚演出。我想待在有电视的地方。” Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday — and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, you weren’t eleven every day. 星期一。这使哈利想起了什么。如果今天是星期一——因为有了电视，你通常可以指望达德里知道今天是星期几——那么明天，星期二，就是哈利的第11个生日了。当然，他的生日从来就不是那么有趣——去年，德思礼一家送给他一个衣架和一双弗农姨父的旧袜子。不过，你也不是每天都11岁。 Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he’d bought. 弗农姨父回来了，面带微笑。他还拿着一个又长又薄的包裹，佩妮姨妈问他买了什么，他没有回答。 “Found the perfect place!” he said. “Come on! Everyone out!” “找到了完美的地方!””他说。“来吧!每个人都出去!” It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there. 车外很冷。弗农姨父指着一块看上去像大海外的大石头。你能想象得到的最简陋的小棚屋坐落在岩石顶上。有一件事是肯定的，里面没有电视。 “Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. “And this gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!” “今晚有暴风雨预报!”维能姨丈高兴地拍着手说。“这位先生好心地答应把他的船借给我们!” A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them. 一个没有牙齿的老人缓缓地向他们走来，带着相当邪恶的笑容，指着他们脚下铁灰色的水里漂着的一只旧划艇。 “I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, “so all aboard!” “我已经给我们弄到了一些口粮，”弗农姨父说，“所以大家都上船吧!” It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. 船里很冷。冰冷的浪花和雨水顺着他们的脖子往下淌，一阵冷风拂过他们的脸。大约过了几个小时，他们来到了那块岩石前。弗农姨父在岩石上滑来滑去，领着他们来到了那座破旧的房子前。 The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms. 里面很可怕;它散发着强烈的海草味，风从木墙的缝隙中呼啸而过，壁炉里湿漉漉的，空空如也。只有两个房间。 Uncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. 弗农姨父的口粮原来是每人一包薯条和四根香蕉。他试图点火，但空薯片袋只是冒烟和枯萎了。 “Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said cheerfully. “现在我可以写一些这样的信了，是吗?”他高兴地说。 He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn’t cheer him up at all. 他心情很好。显然，他认为没有人有机会在暴风雨中到达这里来投递邮件。哈利私下里表示同意，尽管他一点也不高兴。 As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket. 夜幕降临时，暴风雨即将来临。巨浪的浪花拍打着小屋的墙壁，一阵狂风刮得肮脏的窗户格格作响。佩妮姨妈在第二间屋子里发现了几条发霉的毯子，就在虫蛀的沙发上给达德里铺了张床。她和弗农姨父去了隔壁那张乱糟糟的床上，哈利只能在最柔软的地板上蜷成一团，盖在最薄、最破的毯子下面。 The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn’t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now. 随着夜幕的降临，暴风雨越刮越猛烈。哈利睡不着。他打了个寒颤，翻了个身，想尽量舒服些，肚子饿得咕咕直叫。半夜时分，达德里的鼾声被低沉的雷声淹没了。达力的手表挂在沙发边上，挂在他那肥肥的手腕上，表盘上的亮光告诉哈利，再过十分钟他就十一岁了。他躺在床上，看着自己的生日一天天临近，心里纳闷德思礼一家会不会还记得，也纳闷写信的人现在在哪儿。 Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he’d be able to steal one somehow. 还有五分钟。哈利听到外面有吱吱的声音。他希望屋顶不会塌下来，尽管如果塌下来他可能会暖和些。还有四分钟。也许女贞路的那座房子在他们回来的时候会堆满了信，他就能设法偷到一封信。 Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? 还有三分钟。那是大海，像那样重重地拍打着岩石吗?还有(还有两分钟)那奇怪的嘎吱嘎吱的声音是什么?岩石崩落到海里了吗? One minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds⋯ twenty⋯ ten⋯ nine — maybe he’d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him — three⋯ two⋯ one⋯ 再过一分钟他就十一岁了。30秒20⋯⋯十⋯九——也许他叫醒达德利,只是为了激怒他,三两个⋯⋯⋯ BOOM. 一阵巨响。 The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in. 整个木屋都在颤抖，哈利笔直地坐着，盯着门。有人在外面敲门要进来。 J.K. Rowling J.K.罗琳 Harry Potter &amp; The Sorcerer’s Stone 《哈利波特与魔法石》]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s StoneChapter Three Letters from No OneThe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches. Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting. This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny. “They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,” he told Harry. “Want to come upstairs and practice?” “No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had anything as horrible as your head down it — it might be sick.” Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he’d said. One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg’s. Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as usual. It turned out she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several years. That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings’ boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life. As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn’t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh. There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water. “What’s this?” he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question. “Your new school uniform,” she said. Harry looked in the bowl again. “Oh,” he said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.” “Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing some of Dudley’s old things gray for you. It’ll look just like everyone else’s when I’ve finished.” Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High — like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably. Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry’s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table. They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat. “Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. “Make Harry get it.” “Get the mail, Harry.” “Make Dudley get it.” “Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.” Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry. Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: Mr. H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H. “Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. “What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?” He chuckled at his own joke. Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope. Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard. “Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny whelk⋯” “Dad!” said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry’s got something!” Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon. “That’s mine!” said Harry, trying to snatch it back. “Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge. “P-P-Petunia!” he gasped. Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise. “Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!” They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn’t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick. “I want to read that letter,” he said loudly. “I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine.” “Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope. Harry didn’t move. “I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted. “Let me see it!” demanded Dudley. “OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor. “Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, “look at the address — how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don’t think they’re watching the house?” “Watching — spying — might be following us,” muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. “But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don’t want—” Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen. “No,” he said finally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t get an answer⋯ Yes, that’s best⋯ we won’t do anything⋯” “But—” “I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we swear when we took him in we’d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?” That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he’d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard. “Where’s my letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. “Who’s writing to me?” “No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said Uncle Vernon shortly. “I have burned it.” “It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my cupboard on it.” “SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful. “Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking⋯ you’re really getting a bit big for it⋯ we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley’s second bedroom. “Why?” said Harry. “Don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this stuff upstairs, now.” The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor’s dog; in the corner was Dudley’s first-ever television set, which he’d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they’d never been touched. From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don’t want him in there⋯ I need that room⋯ make him get out⋯” Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he’d have given anything to be up here. Today he’d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it. Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly. When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, “There’s another one! ‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive — ‘” With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in his hand. “Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” he wheezed at Harry. “Dudley — go — just go.” Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first letter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this time he’d make sure they didn’t fail. He had a plan. The repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn’t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights. He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door — “AAAAARRRGH!” Harry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat — something alive! Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink. “I want — ” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot. “See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver them they’ll just give up.” “I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.” “Oh, these people’s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn’t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom. Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” as he worked, and jumped at small noises. On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor. “Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” Dudley asked Harry in amazement. On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. “No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, “no damn letters today—” Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one — “Out! OUT!” Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor. “That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. “I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!” He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag. They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. “Shake ‘em off⋯ shake ‘em off,” he would mutter whenever he did this. They didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He’d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he’d missed five television programs he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer. Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering⋯ They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table. “’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an ‘undred of these at the front desk.” She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: Mr. H. Potter Room 17 Railview Hotel Cokeworth Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared. “I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room. “Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage. “Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared. It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled. “It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great Humberto’s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.” Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday — and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, you weren’t eleven every day. Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he’d bought. “Found the perfect place!” he said. “Come on! Everyone out!” It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there. “Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. “And this gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!” A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them. “I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, “so all aboard!” It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms. Uncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. “Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said cheerfully. He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn’t cheer him up at all. As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket. The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn’t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now. Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he’d be able to steal one somehow. Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? One minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds⋯ twenty⋯ ten⋯ nine — maybe he’d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him — three⋯ two⋯ one⋯ BOOM. The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in. J.K. Rowling Harry Potter &amp; The Sorcerer’s Stone]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s Stone 《哈利波特与魔法石》Chapter Two The Vanishing Glass 第二章 消失的玻璃 Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys’ front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. 将近十年过去了，德思礼一家醒来发现他们的侄子站在门前的台阶上，但女贞路几乎没有什么变化。太阳还是在前面那个整洁的花园里升起来，照亮了德思礼家前门上的四号铜器;它悄悄溜进了他们的起居室，几乎和德思礼先生看到那则关于猫头鹰的灾难性新闻的那天晚上一模一样。只有壁炉架上的照片才真正显示出时间的流逝。十年前,曾有很多的照片看起来像一个大的粉红色的沙滩球穿不同颜色的帽子,但达德利·德思礼不再是一个婴儿,和现在的照片显示一个大的金发男孩骑自行车,在旋转木马上,和他的父亲玩电脑游戏,被母亲拥抱和亲吻。房间里没有任何迹象表明房子里住着另外一个男孩。 Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. 然而哈利波特还在那儿，此刻还在睡觉，但睡不了多久。他的佩妮姨妈醒了，是她那尖利的声音发出了这一天的第一个声音。 “Up! Get up! Now!” “起来!起来!现在!” Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. 哈利被惊醒了。他姨妈又在敲门。 “Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the same dream before. “起来!”她尖叫着。哈利听见她朝厨房走去，接着是煎锅放在炉子上的声音。他翻了个身，试图回忆起他做过的梦。这是一次很好的经历。里面有一辆会飞的摩托车。他有一种奇怪的感觉，他以前做过同样的梦。 His aunt was back outside the door. 他姨妈又回到门外。 “Are you up yet?” she demanded. “你起床了吗?””她问道。 “Nearly,” said Harry. “马上,”哈利说。 “Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don’t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.” “好吧，走吧，我要你去照看熏肉。你敢让它烧起来，我要在达蒂的生日那天事事完美。” Harry groaned. 哈利呻吟着。 “What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the door. “你说什么?”他的婶婶猛然推开门。 “Nothing, nothing⋯” “没什么,没什么⋯” Dudley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. 达力的生日——他怎么可能忘记呢?哈利慢慢地从床上爬起来，开始找袜子。他在床下找到一双，从其中一只蜘蛛身上扯下一只，然后穿上。哈利习惯了蜘蛛，因为楼梯下的碗柜里爬满了蜘蛛，而他就睡在那里。 When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, but he was very fast. 他穿好衣服后，就从大厅走到厨房。桌子几乎被达力所有的生日礼物都遮住了。达德里似乎得到了他想要的新电脑，更不用说第二台电视和那辆赛车了。达德里为什么想要一辆赛车，这对哈利来说是个谜，因为达德里很胖，而且讨厌运动——当然，除非是在打别人。达力最喜欢的沙袋是哈利，但他经常抓不住他。哈利没有看出来，但他跑得很快。 Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. 也许这与哈利住在一个黑暗的碗柜里有关，但就他的年龄来说，哈利一直又小又瘦。他看上去比实际年龄更小、更瘦，因为他只穿达德里的旧衣服，而达德里大约是他的四倍大。哈利有一张瘦削的脸，膝盖上有疙瘩，黑头发，一双明亮的绿眼睛。他戴着一副用透明胶带粘在一起的圆眼镜，因为达德里经常打他的鼻子。哈利唯一喜欢自己外表的是前额上一道闪电形状的很薄的伤疤。他从记事起就有了它，他记得第一个问佩妮姨妈的问题就是他是怎么得到它的。 “In the car crash when your parents died,” she had said. “And don’t ask questions.” “在你父母去世的那场车祸中，”她说。“不要问问题。” Don’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. 不要问问题——这是和德思礼一家平静生活的首要原则。 Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. 维能姨丈走进厨房时，哈利正在翻熏肉。 “Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning greeting. “梳你的头发!他叫道，作为早晨的问候。 About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over the place. 大约每个星期，维能姨丈都会从报纸上往外看一次，大喊哈利需要理发了。哈利剪的头发肯定比班上其他男孩的总和还多，但这没有什么区别，他的头发就是那样长出来的——到处都是。 Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. 达力和妈妈来到厨房时，哈利正在煎鸡蛋。达力长得很像维能姨丈。他有一张粉红色的大脸，脖子不长，一双水汪汪的小蓝眼睛，一头浓密的金发平滑地披在他那又厚又胖的头上。佩妮姨妈常说达德里像个小天使——哈利常说达德里像头戴假发的猪。 Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn’t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell. 哈利把盛着鸡蛋和咸肉的盘子放在桌子上，因为没有太多的空间，这很困难。达力正在数他的礼物。他的脸就拉下来了。 “Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father. “That’s two less than last year.” “三十六个，”他抬头看着父母说。“比去年少了两个。” “Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, see, it’s here under this big one from Mummy and Daddy.” “亲爱的，你还没数玛姬阿姨送的礼物呢，瞧，就在爸爸妈妈送的这个大礼物下面。” “All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. “好吧，那就三十七个。”达力说着，脸涨得通红。哈利看得出达力要大发雷霆了，他开始狼吞虎咽地吃起熏肉来，生怕达力把桌子掀翻。 Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, “And we’ll buy you another two presents while we’re out today. How’s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right” 佩妮姨妈显然也觉察到了危险，因为她马上说:“我们今天出去的时候再给你买两件礼物。”popkin怎么样?两个礼物。这样可以吗? Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty⋯ thirty⋯” 达力想了一会儿。看起来很辛苦。最后,他慢慢地说,“所以我要三十三十⋯⋯” “Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia. “三十九，亲爱的，”佩妮姨妈说。 “Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. “All right then.” “哦。达力重重地坐下来，抓起最近的一个包裹。“那好吧。” Uncle Vernon chuckled. 弗农姨父咯咯地笑了。 “Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his father. ‘Atta boy, Dudley!” He ruffled Dudley’s hair. “小家伙和他爸爸一样，希望自己的钱花得值。”“好小子,达德利!他揉了揉达力的头发。 At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. 这时电话铃响了，帕尤妮亚姨妈去接电话，哈利和维能姨丈则在一旁看着达德里拆包裹，里面有一辆赛车、一台摄像机、一架遥控飞机、16个新电脑游戏和一台录像机。当帕尤妮亚姨妈从电话里回来的时候，他正在撕一块金手表上的纸，看上去又生气又担心。 “Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s broken her leg. She can’t take him.” She jerked her head in Harry’s direction. “坏消息，弗农，”她说。“夫人。费格摔断了腿。她不能带走他。她把头转向哈利的方向。 Dudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley’s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned. 达力吓得张大了嘴巴，但哈利的心猛地一跳。每年达德利生日那天，他的父母都会带他和一个朋友出去玩，去冒险公园，去汉堡店，或者去看电影。每年，哈利都被落在费格太太的后面。费格太太是位疯疯癫癫的老太太，住在两条街以外。哈利讨厌那里。整个房子都有卷心菜的味道，费格太太让他看她养过的猫的照片。 “Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he’d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. “现在什么?佩妮姨妈愤怒地看着哈利，好像这是他事先计划好的。哈利知道他应该为费格太太摔断了腿而感到难过，但当他提醒自己要整整一年以后才能再看到小石子、白雪、爪子先生和小俏皮时，事情就不那么容易了。 “We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested. “我们可以给玛吉打电话，”弗农姨父建议道。 “Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.” “别傻了，弗农，她讨厌那个男孩。” The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn’t there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a slug. 德思礼一家经常这样谈论哈利，好像他不在场似的——或者更确切地说，好像他是一个非常讨厌的家伙，不能理解他们，像条鼻涕虫。 “What about what’s-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?” “她叫什么名字，你的朋友伊冯?” “On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “在马略卡岛度假，”佩妮姨妈厉声说道。 “You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully (he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s computer). “你可以把我留在这儿，”哈利满怀希望地插嘴说(他可以换个口味，在电视上看他想看的东西，甚至可以试试达德里的电脑)。 Aunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a lemon. 佩妮姨妈看上去好像刚吞下一个柠檬。 “And come back and find the house in ruins?” she snarled. “回来后发现房子已成废墟?””她纠缠不清。 “I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening. “我不会把房子炸掉的。”哈利说，但他们没在听。 “I suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said Aunt Petunia slowly, “⋯ and leave him in the car⋯” “我想我们可以带他去动物园,”佩妮姨妈慢慢地说,“汽车⋯⋯,离开他” “That car’s new, he’s not sitting in it alone⋯” “那车的新,他不是独自坐在⋯” Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn’t really crying — it had been years since he’d really cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. 达力开始大哭起来。事实上，他并不是真的哭——他已经好多年没有哭过了——但他知道，如果他皱着脸哭，他妈妈会给他任何他想要的东西。 “Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him spoil your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms around him. “小笨蛋，别哭，妈妈不会让他破坏你的特别日子的!”她喊道，伸出双臂搂住他。 “I⋯ don’t⋯ want⋯ him⋯ t-t-to come!” Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. “He always sp-spoils everything!” He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother’s arms. “我⋯⋯不希望他⋯⋯t-t-to来!达力假装抽泣着大声喊道。“他总是破坏一切!”他从母亲怀里的缝隙里朝哈利狠狠地笑了笑。 Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. 正在这时，门铃响了——“哦，天哪，他们来了!”佩妮姨妈发疯似地说。过了一会儿，达德里最好的朋友皮尔斯·波基斯和他妈妈走了进来。皮尔斯是个骨瘦如柴的男孩，长着一张像老鼠一样的脸。他通常是那个在达力打他们的时候，把他们的胳膊放在背后的人。达力立刻停止了假装哭。 Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. 半小时后，哈利不敢相信自己的运气，和皮尔斯、达力一起坐在德思礼家汽车的后座上，这是他有生以来第一次去动物园。他的姨丈姨妈想不出还有什么别的办法来对付他，但在他们离开之前，维能姨丈已经把哈利拉到一边去了。 “I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.” “我警告你，”他说着，把他那张紫色的大脸凑近哈利的脸，“我现在警告你，孩子——任何有趣的事，任何事——你从现在到圣诞节都要呆在那个柜子里。” “I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly⋯” “我不打算做任何事情,”哈利说,“诚实”⋯ But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one ever did. 但是弗农姨父不相信他。从来没有人这么做过。 The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t make them happen. 问题是，哈利身边经常发生奇怪的事情，告诉德思礼一家他没有让这些事情发生是没有用的。 Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn’t explain how it had grown back so quickly. 有一次，帕尤妮亚姨妈厌倦了哈利从理发店里回来，看上去好像他根本没理过头发似的。她拿了一把厨房里的剪刀，把他的头发剪得很短，除了刘海，几乎都秃了，她把刘海留了下来，“为了遮住那道可怕的伤疤。”达力嘲笑哈利，哈利一夜没合眼，想象着第二天要去学校。在学校里，他穿着宽松的衣服，戴着胶布眼镜，已经被人嘲笑了。然而,第二天早上起床的时候,他发现他的头发就像佩妮姨妈剪以前。他在柜子要在一周内,尽管他曾试图解释说,他无法解释它如何增长如此之快。 Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn’t punished. 还有一次，帕尤妮亚姨妈试图强迫他穿上达德里那件讨厌的旧毛衣(棕色的，上面有橙色的泡泡球)。她越想把它拉过他的头，它就显得越小，直到最后它可能适合一个木偶，但肯定不适合哈利。帕尤妮亚姨妈断定它一定是洗后缩水了，哈利没有受到惩罚，这让他松了一口气。 On the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry’s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump. 另一方面，他因为被发现在学校厨房的屋顶上而惹上了大麻烦。达德里一伙像往常一样一直在追他，突然，出乎哈利和其他人的意料，他居然坐在烟囱上。德思礼一家收到哈利的女校长写来的一封非常生气的信，信中说哈利一直在爬学校的大楼。但他所做的(当他隔着锁着的碗柜门对弗农姨父大喊大叫时)就是跳到厨房门外的大垃圾桶后面。哈利猜想，一定是风把他吹到了半空中。 But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn’t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room. 但今天，一切顺利。即使是和达德里和皮尔斯在一起，也值得在学校、柜子和费格太太卷心菜味的客厅以外的地方消磨一天。 While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles. 维能姨丈一边开车一边向佩妮姨妈抱怨。他喜欢抱怨:工作中的人、哈利、议会、哈利、银行和哈利只是他最喜欢的科目中的几个。今天早上，是摩托车。 “⋯ roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,” he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. “⋯像疯子一样呼啸而去,年轻的流氓,”他说,作为一个摩托车超越他们。 “I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, remembering suddenly. “It was flying.” “我做了一个关于摩托车的梦。”哈利突然想起。“这是飞行。” Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DON’T FLY!” 弗农姨父差点撞到前面的车。他在座位上转过身来，冲着哈利喊道，他的脸就像长着胡子的大甜菜头:“摩托车不会飞!” Dudley and Piers sniggered. 达力和皮尔斯窃笑起来。 “I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was only a dream.” “我知道他们不知道，”哈利说。“那只是个梦。” But he wished he hadn’t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. 但他希望自己什么也没说。如果说有一件事比他的提问更让德思礼一家讨厌的话，那就是他谈论任何不应该发生的事情，不管是在梦里还是在动画片里——他们似乎认为他可能会有危险的想法。 It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t blond. 那是一个阳光明媚的星期六，动物园里挤满了人。德思礼一家在门口给达力和皮尔斯买了大巧克力冰淇淋，然后，因为车厢里面带微笑的女士在赶哈利走之前问他想要什么，他们就给他买了一个便宜的柠檬汽水。这也不坏，哈利想，一面舔着它，一面看着一只大猩猩抓着它的头，它看起来很像达德里，只不过不是金发。 Harry had the best morning he’d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. 哈利度过了很久以来最好的一个早晨。他小心翼翼地走到离德思礼一家稍远的地方，免得达力和皮尔斯在午饭前就开始对动物们感到厌烦了，于是他们又恢复了打他的嗜好。他们在动物园的餐厅吃饭，达德里因为尼克伯克郡的荣耀冰淇淋不够而大发脾气，弗农姨父又给他买了一个，哈利被允许吃完第一个。 Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. 后来，哈利觉得他应该知道这一切太美好了，不会长久。 After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can — but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. 午饭后，他们去了爬虫馆。里面又冷又黑，墙上的窗户都亮着。在玻璃后面，各种各样的蜥蜴和蛇在木头和石头上爬来爬去。达力和皮尔斯想看看又大又毒的眼镜蛇和又粗又能咬人的蟒蛇。达力很快就找到了那条最大的蛇。它本可以把自己的身体绕着弗农姨父的车转两圈，然后把它压进垃圾桶里的——但此刻它看起来没有心情。事实上，它睡得很熟。 Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. 达力站在那里，鼻子紧贴着玻璃，盯着闪闪发光的棕色线圈。 “Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge. “让它动起来，”他对父亲抱怨道。弗农姨父敲了敲玻璃，但蛇纹丝不动。 “Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. “再来一次。”达力命令道。弗农姨父用指节狠狠地敲了敲玻璃，但蛇只是继续打盹。 “This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. “这太无聊了。”达力抱怨道。他慢吞吞地走了。 Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. 哈利走到坦克前面，目不转睛地盯着那条蛇。他不会感到奇怪，如果它死于无聊本身——除了愚蠢的人用手指敲玻璃试图整天打扰它以外，没有别的同伴。这比把碗橱当卧室还要糟糕，因为只有佩妮姨妈在那儿敲门叫你起床;至少他还能参观房子的其他部分。 The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s. 蛇突然睁开了圆圆的眼睛。慢慢地，慢慢地，它抬起头，直到它的眼睛与哈利的眼睛平齐。 It winked. 它眨了眨眼。 Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. 哈利盯着。然后他迅速环顾四周，看看是否有人在看。他们没有。他回头看了看蛇，也眨眨眼。 The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: 蛇猛地把头转向维能姨丈和达力，然后抬起眼睛看着天花板。它看了哈利一眼，十分清楚地说: “I get that all the time.” “我一直都明白。” “I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.” “我知道。”哈利透过玻璃喃喃地说，尽管他不敢肯定蛇能听见他的话。“一定很烦人。” The snake nodded vigorously. 蛇有力地点点头。 “Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked. “你到底是从哪儿来的?””哈利问。 The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. 蛇用尾巴戳了一下玻璃旁边的一个小标志。哈利凝视着它。 Boa Constrictor, Brazil. 蟒蛇,巴西。 “Was it nice there?” “那里好吗?” The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?” 那条大蟒蛇又用尾巴戳了一下那块牌子，哈利继续读下去:这个标本是在动物园里培育出来的。“哦，我明白了——这么说你从没去过巴西?” As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!” 蛇摇了摇头，哈利身后一声震耳欲聋的喊叫吓得他们两个都跳了起来。“达德利!他忽然!快来看这条蛇!你不会相信它在做什么!” Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. 达力摇摇摆摆地以最快的速度朝他们走来。 “Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. “让开，你。”他说，一拳打在哈利的肋骨上。哈利大吃一惊，重重地摔在水泥地上。接下来发生的事情发生得如此之快，以至于没人知道是怎么发生的——前一秒，皮尔斯和达力还紧紧地靠在玻璃上，下一秒，他们就惊恐地尖叫着往回跳。 Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. 哈利坐起来，喘着气;大蟒蛇水箱前面的玻璃消失了。那条大蛇迅速地展开身子，滑到地板上。爬虫馆里的人们尖叫着开始向出口跑去。 As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come⋯ Thanksss, amigo.” 蛇迅速滑过去的他,哈利可以宣誓低,嘶嘶的声音说,“巴西,我来⋯Thanksss,朋友。” The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. 爬虫馆的管理员惊呆了。 “But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?” 可那只玻璃，”他不停地说，“玻璃到哪儿去了?” The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?” 动物园园长亲自给佩妮姨妈泡了一杯浓浓的甜茶，并一再道歉。皮尔斯和达力只能胡言乱语。哈利看到,蛇没做什么除了吸附开玩笑地紧跟在他们后面,因为它通过,但当他们都回到弗农姨父的车,达德利告诉他们如何咬掉了近他的腿,而皮尔斯咒骂它曾试图挤死他了。但最糟糕的是，至少对哈利来说，皮尔斯居然平静下来，说:“哈利在跟它说话，是吗，哈利?” Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. 弗农姨父一直等到皮尔斯安全走出屋子，才开始攻击哈利。他气得几乎说不出话来。他勉强说了句:“去碗柜里——呆着——不要吃饭。”然后瘫倒在椅子上，佩妮姨妈不得不跑过去给他倒了一大杯白兰地。 Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn’t know what time it was and he couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. 很久以后，哈利躺在他的黑柜子里，希望他有一块手表。他不知道现在是什么时候，也不能肯定德思礼一家是否睡着了。在他们走之前，他不能冒险溜到厨房去找食物。 He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn’t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn’t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. 从记事起，他就和德思礼一家一起生活了将近十年，十年痛苦的岁月，从他还是个婴儿的时候起，他的父母就在那场车祸中丧生。他不记得父母去世时他在车里。有时，当他在碗柜里长时间苦思冥想时，他会产生一种奇怪的幻觉:一道眩目的绿光闪过，前额一阵灼痛。他想，这就是车祸，尽管他无法想象所有的绿灯是从哪里来的。他完全不记得他的父母了。他的叔叔婶婶从来不提起他们，当然也不允许他问问题。房子里没有他们的照片。 When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. 在他年轻的时候，哈利经常梦见某个不知名的亲戚来把他带走，但这从未发生过;德思礼一家是他唯一的家人。然而，有时他认为(或者也许希望)街上的陌生人似乎认识他。他们也是非常奇怪的陌生人。有一次，一个戴紫罗兰色高帽的小个子男人跟帕尤妮亚姨妈和达力出去买东西时向他鞠了一躬。佩妮姨妈怒气冲冲地问哈利是否认识那个人，然后什么也没买就把他们赶出了商店。有一次在公共汽车上，一个穿着绿色衣服、看上去很野性的老妇人愉快地向他挥手。有一天，一个穿紫色长外套的秃头男人在街上真的握了握手，然后一言不发地走开了。所有这些人最奇怪的地方是，当哈利试图靠近他们时，他们似乎消失了。 At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang. 在学校里，哈利一个人也没有。大家都知道达德里一伙人讨厌那个穿着肥大的旧衣服，戴着破眼镜的古怪的哈利·波特。 J.K.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s StoneChapter Two The Vanishing GlassNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys’ front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. “Up! Get up! Now!” Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. “Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the same dream before. His aunt was back outside the door. “Are you up yet?” she demanded. “Nearly,” said Harry. “Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don’t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.” Harry groaned. “What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the door. “Nothing, nothing⋯” Dudley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, but he was very fast. Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. “In the car crash when your parents died,” she had said. “And don’t ask questions.” Don’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. “Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning greeting. About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over the place. Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn’t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell. “Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father. “That’s two less than last year.” “Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, see, it’s here under this big one from Mummy and Daddy.” “All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, “And we’ll buy you another two presents while we’re out today. How’s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right” Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty⋯ thirty⋯” “Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia. “Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. “All right then.” Uncle Vernon chuckled. “Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his father. ‘Atta boy, Dudley!” He ruffled Dudley’s hair. At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. “Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s broken her leg. She can’t take him.” She jerked her head in Harry’s direction. Dudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley’s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned. “Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he’d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. “We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested. “Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.” The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn’t there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a slug. “What about what’s-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?” “On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully (he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s computer). Aunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a lemon. “And come back and find the house in ruins?” she snarled. “I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening. “I suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said Aunt Petunia slowly, “⋯ and leave him in the car⋯” “That car’s new, he’s not sitting in it alone⋯” Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn’t really crying — it had been years since he’d really cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. “Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him spoil your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms around him. “I⋯ don’t⋯ want⋯ him⋯ t-t-to come!” Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. “He always sp-spoils everything!” He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother’s arms. Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. “I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.” “I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly⋯” But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one ever did. The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t make them happen. Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn’t explain how it had grown back so quickly. Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn’t punished. On the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry’s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump. But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn’t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room. While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles. “⋯ roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,” he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. “I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, remembering suddenly. “It was flying.” Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DON’T FLY!” Dudley and Piers sniggered. “I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was only a dream.” But he wished he hadn’t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t blond. Harry had the best morning he’d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can — but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. “Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge. “Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. “This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: “I get that all the time.” “I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.” The snake nodded vigorously. “Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. “Was it nice there?” The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?” As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!” Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. “Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come⋯ Thanksss, amigo.” The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. “But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?” The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?” Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn’t know what time it was and he couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn’t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn’t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang. J.K.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s Stone 《哈利波特与魔法石》Chapter One The Boy Who Lived 第一章 活下来的男孩 Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense. 女贞路四号的德思礼夫妇自豪地说，他们一切都很正常，非常感谢。他们是你最不可能想到会卷入任何奇怪或神秘的事情中的人，因为他们就是不相信这种无稽之谈。 Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. 德思礼先生是一家名为格朗宁斯的钻头制造公司的董事。他身材魁梧，粗壮结实，几乎没有脖子，尽管他的胡子很大。德思礼太太又瘦又白，脖子几乎是平时的两倍，这对她很有用，因为她花了很多时间伸长脖子，越过花园的篱笆，窥探邻居。德思礼家有个小儿子叫达力，在他们看来，再没有比这更好的孩子了。 The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that. 德思礼一家拥有他们想要的一切，但他们也有一个秘密，他们最担心的是有人会发现它。他们认为如果有人发现波特一家的事，他们是无法忍受的。波特太太是德思礼太太的妹妹，但他们已经好几年没见面了。事实上，德思礼太太假装她没有妹妹，因为她的妹妹和她的不成器的丈夫都尽可能地不像德思礼。德思礼一家一想到如果波特一家走到街上，邻居们会怎么说，就不寒而栗。德思礼一家知道波特一家也有一个小儿子，但他们甚至从未见过他。这个男孩是不让波特一家进来的另一个好理由;他们不希望达力和那样的孩子混在一起。 When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. 当德思礼夫妇在阴沉、灰暗的星期二醒来时，我们的故事开始了。外面多云的天空并没有任何迹象表明，这个国家很快就会发生奇怪而神秘的事情。德思礼先生一边哼着小曲儿，一边挑选着他最讨厌的领带去上班。 None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. 他们谁也没有注意到一只黄褐色的大猫头鹰从窗前飞过。 At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. 八点半的时候，德思礼先生拿起公文包，在德思礼太太的脸颊上亲了一下，想跟达力吻别，但没有成功，因为达力正在发脾气，把麦片往墙上扔。 “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s drive. “小家伙。”德思礼先生笑着离开了家。他上了车，从四号车道倒车出去。 It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. 就在街道的拐角处，他注意到第一个奇怪的迹象——一只猫在看地图。有那么一瞬间，德思礼先生没有意识到他看到了什么——然后他猛地转过头去再看一看。女贞路的拐角处站着一只虎斑猫，但看不见地图。他在想什么呢?那一定是光的诡计。德思礼先生眨了眨眼，盯着猫看。它盯着回来的。当德思礼先生开着车转过街角沿路而上时，他从镜子里看到了那只猫。现在它正在看女贞路的牌子——不，看那牌子;猫不会看地图和标志。德思礼先生轻轻地摇了一下身子，把猫从他的脑子里赶了出去。当他驱车进城时，他什么也没想，只想到他希望那天能得到一大批钻机。 But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt — these people were obviously collecting for something⋯ yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. 但在小镇的边缘，他的脑子里却被别的东西赶出了钻机。像往常一样，早上堵车的时候，他坐在那里，不禁注意到周围似乎有很多穿着奇怪的人。穿着斗篷的人。德思礼先生受不了那些穿奇装怪服的人——你在年轻人身上看到的那种装腔作势!他认为这是一种愚蠢的新时尚。他用手指咚咚地敲着方向盘，他的目光落在一群站在旁边的怪人身上。他们兴奋地交头接耳。德思礼先生很生气，因为他发现其中有几个根本就不年轻;唉，那人一定比他年纪大，穿着一件翡翠绿的披风!他胆子真大!但随后他忽然突然意识到,这可能是一些愚蠢的特技——这些人显然收集的东西⋯是的,这将是它。车辆继续前行，几分钟后，德思礼先生来到格朗宁斯停车场，脑子里又回到了钻机上。 Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery. 德思礼先生的办公室在九楼，他总是背对着窗户坐着。如果他没有，他可能会发现那天早上更难集中精力练习。他没有看见猫头鹰在光天化日之下飞过，虽然街上的人看见了;他们张大嘴巴，指指点点，看着猫头鹰一只接一只地从头顶飞过。他们中的大多数人甚至在晚上也没见过猫头鹰。然而，德思礼先生度过了一个完全正常的、没有猫头鹰的早晨。他对着五个人大喊大叫。他打了几个重要的电话，又大喊了几声。他的心情一直很好，直到吃午饭的时候，他想舒展一下筋力，到马路对面的面包店去买一个小面包。 He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying. 他完全忘记了那些穿着斗篷的人，直到他在面包店旁边经过了一群人。他走过时生气地看着他们。他不知道为什么，但他们使他不安。这群人也在兴奋地窃窃私语，他连一个收集罐也看不见。在他从他们身边走回来的路上，他手里抓着一个装在袋子里的大甜甜圈，听到他们说了几句话。 “The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard—” “波特一家，没错，我听到的就是——” “— yes, their son, Harry—” “是的，他们的儿子，哈利。” Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. 德思礼先生停了下来。恐惧淹没了他。他回头看了看那些窃窃私语的人，好像想对他们说点什么，但又想了想。 He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking⋯ no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn’t blame her — if he’d had a sister like that⋯ but all the same, those people in cloaks⋯ 他冲过马路，匆匆赶到办公室，厉声叫秘书别来打扰他，抓起电话，刚要拨完家里的号码，他就改变了主意。他把接收下来,抚摸着他的胡子,思考⋯不,他是愚蠢的。波特并不是一个不寻常的名字。他肯定有很多人叫波特，他们有一个儿子叫哈利。仔细想想，他甚至不确定他的侄子叫哈利。他甚至从未见过那个男孩。可能是哈维。哈罗德。没有必要让德思礼太太担心;一提起她姐姐，她总是很不高兴。他不怪她,如果他有一个妹妹想⋯但都是一样的,穿着斗篷的人⋯ He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. 那天下午，他发现很难集中精力操练。当他5点钟离开大楼时，他还是那么担心，以至于直接撞到了门外的一个人。 “Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!” “对不起，”他咕哝着说，那个瘦小的老人绊了一跤，差点摔倒。过了几秒钟，德思礼先生才意识到那个人穿着一件紫罗兰色的斗篷。他几乎被撞倒在地，似乎一点也不难过。相反，他的脸上绽开了灿烂的笑容，用一种让过路人都盯着看的尖声说道:“亲爱的先生，不要难过，今天没有什么能让我难过的!”高兴吧，神秘人终于走了!甚至像你这样的麻瓜也应该庆祝一下，这个快乐的日子!” And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off. 老人抱住德思礼先生的腰，走开了。 Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of imagination. 德思礼先生一动不动地站在那里。一个完全陌生的人拥抱了他。他还以为别人叫他麻瓜，管他叫什么。他慌乱。他急忙上了车，动身回家，希望这是他的想象，这是他以前从未有过的希望，因为他不赞成想象。 As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw — and it didn’t improve his mood — was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. 当他把车开进四号车道时，他看到的第一件事——这并没有改善他的情绪——就是他早上看到的那只虎斑猫。它现在正坐在他花园的墙上。他肯定是同一个人;它的眼睛周围有同样的斑点。 “Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly. “嘘!”德思礼先生大声说。 The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. 猫一动也不动。它只是严厉地看了他一眼。这是猫的正常行为吗?他忽然很好奇。他试图振作起来，让自己进了屋子。他仍然决定不向妻子提起任何事情。 Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: 德思礼太太这一天过得很愉快，很正常。晚饭时，她把隔壁太太和女儿之间的问题，以及达德里是如何学会了一个新单词(“不!”)的都告诉了他。德思礼先生尽量表现得正常些。达力被哄上床后，他及时走进客厅，看到了晚间新闻的最后一篇报道: “And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?” 最后，各地的鸟类观察者报告说，美国猫头鹰今天的行为非常反常。虽然猫头鹰通常在夜间捕猎，白天也很少出现，但自日出以来，人们已经看到数百只猫头鹰在各个方向飞翔。专家无法解释为什么猫头鹰会突然改变他们的睡眠模式。新闻播音员让自己露齿一笑。“最神秘的。现在，请听吉姆·麦高芬为您带来的天气报道。今晚还会有猫头鹰阵雨吗，吉姆?” “Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.” “泰德，”天气预报员说，“我不知道这是怎么回事，但今天表现奇怪的不只是猫头鹰。远在肯特郡、约克郡和邓迪的观众都打电话来告诉我，昨天我答应下的不是雨，而是一场流星雨!也许人们很早就开始庆祝篝火之夜了——直到下个星期，伙计们!但我可以保证今晚会下雨。” Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters⋯ 德思礼先生僵坐在扶手椅上。全英国的流星?猫头鹰在白天飞行?到处都是披着斗篷的神秘人?和一个低语,关于波特一家的传闻⋯ Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er — Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister lately, have you?” 德思礼太太端着两杯茶走进客厅。这是不好的。他得跟她说点什么。他紧张地清了清嗓子。“呃——佩妮，亲爱的——你最近没有收到你姐姐的信吧?” As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister. 正如他所预料的，德思礼太太看上去既震惊又生气。毕竟，他们通常假装她没有妹妹。 “No,” she said sharply. “Why?” “不，”她厉声说。“为什么?” “Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. “Owls⋯ shooting stars⋯ and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today⋯” “新闻里有些有趣的东西，”德思礼先生嘟囔着。“猫头鹰⋯⋯的流星,很有很多人今天在城里⋯” “So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley. “所以呢?德思礼太太厉声说道。 “Well, I just thought⋯ maybe⋯ it was something to do with⋯ you know⋯ her crowd.” “好吧,我只是觉得或许⋯⋯这是与你知道⋯⋯她的人群。” Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son — he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?” 德思礼太太抿着嘴唇喝茶。德思礼先生不知道他是否敢告诉她他听说过“波特”这个名字。他决定他不敢。他尽量漫不经心地说:“他们的儿子——他现在大概有达德里这么大了，是不是?” “I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. “我想是的，”德思礼太太生硬地说。 “What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?” “他叫什么名字来着?”霍华德,不是吗?” “Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.” ”哈利。如果你问我的话，我觉得这名字很难听，很普通。” “Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. “Yes, I quite agree.” “噢，是的，”德思礼先生说，他的心猛地一沉。“是的，我完全同意。” He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something. 当他们上楼睡觉时，他没有再说一个字。当德思礼太太在浴室里的时候，德思礼先生蹑手蹑脚地走到卧室的窗户前，朝下望着前面的花园。猫还在那儿。它凝视着女贞路，仿佛在等待什么。 Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did⋯ if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t think he could bear it. 他在胡思乱想吗?这一切跟波特一家有什么关系吗?如果它确实⋯下车,他们与一对——好吧,他不认为他可以忍受了。 The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind⋯ He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on — he yawned and turned over — it couldn’t affect them⋯ 德思礼一家上了床。德思礼太太很快就睡着了，但德思礼先生却醒着躺在床上，脑子里翻来覆去地想着这件事。睡觉前，他最后一个安慰自己的想法是，即使波特一家也牵涉其中，他们也没有理由靠近他和德思礼太太。陶工很好知道他和佩妮想到他们和他们⋯他看不到他和佩妮如何在任何可能会混淆——他打了个哈欠,翻了——它不能影响他们⋯ How very wrong he was. 他错得太离谱了。 Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. 德思礼先生也许是进入了一种不安的睡眠状态，但门外墙上的那只猫却丝毫没有睡意。它像雕像一样一动不动地坐着，眼睛目不转睛地盯着女贞路的远角。当隔壁街道上的一扇车门砰的一声关上的时候，或者当两只猫头鹰从头顶飞过的时候，它甚至都没有颤抖过。事实上，那只猫几乎半夜才动。 A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. 一个人出现在猫一直在看的角落里，突然出现，悄无声息，你可能以为他是从地下冒出来的。猫的尾巴抽动着，眼睛眯着。 Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore. 像他这样的人在女贞路是从来没有见过的。从他银色的头发和胡须可以看出，他又高又瘦，很老了。他穿着长袍，一件拖地的紫色披风，一双带扣的高跟靴子。他的蓝眼睛在半月形的眼镜后面显得明亮明亮，炯炯有神。他的鼻子又长又弯，好像至少断过两次似的。这个人的名字叫阿不思·邓布利多。 Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.” 阿不思·邓布利多似乎没有意识到他来到了一条从他的名字到他的靴子都不受欢迎的街道上。他忙着在斗篷里翻找东西。但他似乎意识到有人在监视他，因为他突然抬头看了看那只猫，而猫还在街的另一头盯着他看。不知为什么，他一看到那只猫就觉得很有趣。他咯咯地笑着，喃喃地说:“我早该知道的。” He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again — the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it. 他在里面的口袋里找到了他要找的东西。它似乎是一个银色的打火机。他把它弹开，举在空中，咔嚓一声。最近的路灯砰的一声熄灭了。他又点了一下——下一盏灯忽明忽暗地灭了。他点了12下熄灯器，直到整条街只剩下远处的两个小光点，那是猫在看着他的眼睛。如果现在有人往窗外看，哪怕是目光锐利的德思礼太太，也看不见人行道上正在发生的一切。邓布利多把熄灯器塞回斗篷里，沿着街向四号走去，在猫旁边的墙上坐了下来。他没有看它，但过了一会儿，他对它说话了。 “Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.” “真没想到在这儿见到你，麦格教授。” He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled. 他转身对着斑猫微笑，但斑猫已经不见了。相反，他笑着看着一个表情严肃的女人，她戴着一副方形眼镜，眼镜的形状和猫眼睛周围的斑点一模一样。她也穿着一件翡翠斗篷。她的黑发挽成一个紧发髻。她显然很生气。 “How did you know it was me?” she asked. “你怎么知道是我?””她问道。 “My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.” “我亲爱的教授，我从来没有见过猫坐得这么僵硬。” “You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said Professor McGonagall. “如果你整天坐在砖墙上，你会变得僵硬的，”麦格教授说。 “All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.” “一整天?你本来可以庆祝的?我在来这儿的路上，一定度过了十几个宴会。” Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. 麦格教授生气地嗅了嗅。 “Oh yes, I’ve celebrating, all right,” she said impatiently. “You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no — even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I heard it. Flocks of owls⋯ shooting stars⋯ Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.” “哦，是的，我在庆祝，好吧，”她不耐烦地说。“你可能认为他们会更小心一点，但事实并非如此——就连麻瓜们也注意到了一些事情。”这是他们的新闻。她把头扭回德思礼家漆黑的客厅窗户。“我听见了。成群的猫头鹰⋯流星⋯嗯,他们不是完全愚蠢。他们一定会注意到什么。肯特的流星——我敢打赌那是迪达勒斯·迪格尔。他从来没有多少理智。” “You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. “We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.” “你不能怪他们，”邓布利多温和地说。“11年来，我们几乎没有什么值得庆祝的。” “I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “But that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.” “我知道，”麦格教授生气地说。“但我们没有理由失去理智。人们真是太粗心了，大白天走在大街上，甚至不穿麻瓜的衣服，还在传谣言。 She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?” 她斜眼瞟了邓布利多一眼，似乎希望他能告诉她什么，但他没有，于是她继续说。“如果在神秘人似乎终于消失的那一天，麻瓜们发现了我们所有人的情况，那就太好了。”我想他真的走了，邓布利多?” “It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?” “好像是这样。”邓布利多说。“我们有很多要感谢的。你想来点柠檬汁吗?” “A what ?” “什么?” “A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.” “一个柠檬糖。它们是一种我很喜欢的麻瓜糖。” “No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn’t think this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone—” “不用了，谢谢。”麦格教授冷冷地说，好像她认为现在不是喝柠檬汁的时候。“我说过，即使神秘人走了——” “My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this ‘You-Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.” Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ‘You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.” “我亲爱的教授，像您这样一个通情达理的人，一定可以直呼他的名字吧?”所有这些“神秘人”的胡言乱语——11年来，我一直试图说服人们称呼他的真名:伏地魔。麦格教授退缩了一下，但是邓布利多似乎没有注意到，他正在拔两颗柠檬汁。“如果我们一直说‘神秘人’，一切都会变得很混乱。”“我从没见过有什么理由害怕说出伏地魔的名字。” “I know you haven’t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.” “我知道你没有，”麦格教授半是恼怒，半是赞赏地说。“但你是不同的。每个人都知道你是唯一一个——哦，好吧，伏地魔，被吓到了。 “You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I will never have.” “你过奖了。”邓布利多平静地说。“伏地魔拥有我永远不会拥有的力量。” “Only because you’re too — well — noble to use them.” “只是因为你太高尚了，用不上它们。” “It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.” “幸好天很黑。自从庞弗雷夫人告诉我她喜欢我的新耳罩以来，我还没有脸红过。” Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said “The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what they’re saying? About why he’s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?” 麦格教授狠狠地看了邓布利多一眼，说:“猫头鹰根本不是谣言。你知道他们在说什么吗?他为什么失踪了?是什么最终阻止了他?” It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer. 麦格教授似乎已经达到她最急于讨论,她一直等待在一个寒冷的真正原因,整天硬墙,无论是作为一个猫还是作为一个女人她固定邓布利多这样一个穿刺盯着她了。很明显，不管“每个人”说什么，她都不会相信，直到邓布利多告诉她那是真的。可是邓布利多正在挑选另一个柠檬汁，没有回答。 “What they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that they’re — dead.” “他们说，”她接着说，“昨天晚上伏地魔出现在戈德里克山谷。他去找波特一家。有传言说莉莉和詹姆斯·波特已经死了。” Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped. 邓布利多低下头。麦格教授气喘吁吁地说。 “Lily and James⋯ I can’t believe it⋯ I didn’t want to believe it⋯ Oh, Albus⋯” “莉莉和詹姆⋯我不能相信它⋯⋯我不想相信哦,阿不思·⋯” Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. “I know⋯ I know⋯ ” he said heavily. 邓布利多伸出手，拍了拍她的肩膀。“我知道我知道⋯⋯”他说。 Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on. “That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potter’s son, Harry. But he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why he’s gone.” 麦格教授继续说下去，声音颤抖起来。“这还不是全部。他们说他想杀波特的儿子，哈利。但是他不能。他杀不了那个小男孩。没有人知道为什么，也没有人知道怎么回事，但是他们说，当他不能杀死哈利·波特的时候，伏地魔的力量不知怎么就崩溃了——这就是他离开的原因。 Dumbledore nodded glumly. 邓布利多郁闷的点了点头。 “It’s — it’s true ?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s done⋯ all the people he’s killed⋯ he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s just astounding⋯ of all the things to stop him⋯ but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?” “是——是真的吗?”麦格教授结结巴巴地说。“毕竟他所做的所有人他是杀害⋯⋯他不能杀一个小男孩?这只是惊人的所有事情阻止他的⋯⋯但是天堂的名义哈利生存吗?” “We can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “We may never know.” “我们只能猜测。”邓布利多说。“我们可能永远不会知道。” Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by the way?” 麦格教授拿出一条花边手帕，在眼镜下面擦了擦眼睛。邓布利多深深地吸了一口气，从口袋里掏出一只金表仔细看了看。这表很奇怪。它有12只手，但没有数字;相反，行星在边缘移动。邓布利多一定是理解了，因为他把信放回口袋，说:“海格迟到了。”对了，我想是他告诉你我会在这儿的吧?” “Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t suppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?” “是的，”麦格教授说。“我想你不会告诉我你为什么在这儿吧?” “I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the only family he has left now.” “我是来带哈利去见他的叔叔婶婶的。”他们是他现在唯一的亲人。” “You don’t mean - you can’t mean the people who live here ?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. “Dumbledore — you can’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t find two people who are less like us. And they’ve got this son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!” “你是说——你是说住在这里的人吗?”麦格教授叫道，她跳了起来，指着四号教室。“邓布利多——你不能。”我看了一整天。你找不到两个人不像我们。他们有个儿子，我看见他一路上都在踢妈妈，哭喊着要糖果。哈利·波特来住吧!” “It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly. “His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.” “对他来说，这是最好的地方。”邓布利多坚定地说。“等他长大一点，他的姨妈姨父就能把一切都告诉他了。”我给他们写了一封信。 “A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. “Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know his name!” “信?麦格教授虚弱地重复道，又坐回了墙上。“真的吗，邓布利多，你认为你能用一封信解释这一切吗?”这些人永远也不会理解他!他会出名的——一个传奇——如果今天被称为未来的哈利波特日，我不会感到惊讶——会有很多关于哈利的书——我们世界上的每个孩子都会知道他的名字!” “Exactly.” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. “It would be enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even remember! Can you see how much better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take it?” “没错。邓布利多从他的半月形眼镜上方非常严肃地看着他说。这足以让任何一个男孩回头。在他会走路和说话之前就出名了!因为一些他甚至都不记得的事情而出名!你能想象，在他准备好接受这一切之前，他在远离这一切的环境中长大会有多好吗? Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it. 麦格教授张开嘴，改变了主意，咽了口唾沫，然后说:“是的——是的，你说得对，当然。邓布利多，那孩子是怎么到这儿来的?她突然盯着他的斗篷看了一眼，好像他在把哈利藏在斗篷下面。 “Hagrid’s bringing him.” “海格会带他过来。” “You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?” “你认为把这么重要的事情托付给海格是明智的吗?” “I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore. “我愿意把我的生命托付给海格。” “I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t pretend he’s not careless. He does tend to — what was that?” “我不是说他的心有问题，”麦格教授不情愿地说，“但你不能假装他不粗心。他确实倾向于——那是什么?” A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them. 一阵低沉的隆隆声打破了周围的寂静。当他们在街上上下张望，寻找车头灯的信号时，声音越来越大;当他们抬头看天的时候，一辆巨大的摩托车从空中掉了下来，停在了他们面前的路上。 If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets. 如果摩托车很大，那对骑在上面的人来说就不算什么了。他几乎是正常人的两倍高，至少五倍宽。他看上去太大了，简直让人无法接受，太狂野了——长长的浓密的黑发和胡子遮住了他大半张脸，他的手有垃圾桶盖那么大，穿着皮靴的脚像小海豚。他那粗壮有力的胳膊里抱着一捆毯子。 “Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?” “海格。”邓布利多说，听起来如释重负。”。你从哪儿弄来的那辆摩托车?” “Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him, sir.” “借来的，邓布利多教授，先生。”巨人一边说，一边小心翼翼地从摩托车上爬下来。“小天狼星布莱克借给我的。我抓住他了，先生。” “No problems, were there?” “没有问题吧?” “No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.” “没有，爵爷——房子几乎全毁了，但我在麻瓜们开始蜂拥之前就把他救了出来。”我们在布里斯托尔上空飞行时，他睡着了。 Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning. 邓布利多和麦格教授俯身看着那捆毯子。里面，只看得见一个熟睡的男婴。在他前额的一簇乌黑的头发下面，他们可以看到一个形状奇特的伤口，就像一道闪电。 “Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall. “是在哪儿——”麦格教授小声问。 “Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He’ll have that scar forever.” “是的,”邓布利多说。“他会永远留着那个伤疤的。” “Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?” “你不能想点办法吗，邓布利多?” “Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” “即使我能，我也不会。”伤疤可以派上用场。我自己的左膝上就有一个，那是一张完美的伦敦地铁地图。“好吧——把他给我，海格——我们最好把这事办完。” Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house. 邓布利多把哈利抱在怀里，转身朝德思礼家走去。 “Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog. “我能——我能向他告别吗，先生?””海格问。他把他那毛茸茸的大脑袋探到哈利头上，给了他一个肯定是很痒的、胡须似的吻。然后，海格突然像受伤的狗一样嚎叫起来。 “Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “You’ll wake the Muggles!” “Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “You’ll wake the Muggles!” “S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. “But I c-c-can’t stand it — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles—” “对不起，”海格抽泣着说，拿出一块有斑点的大手帕，把脸埋在里面。“可我——我——受不了了——莉莉和詹姆斯死了——可怜的小哈利和麻瓜住在一起了——” “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out. “是的，是的，一切都很令人难过，但是你要控制好自己，海格，否则我们会被发现的。”麦格教授低声说，一边小心翼翼地拍着海格的手臂，这时邓布利多正跨过花园低矮的围墙，朝前门走去。他轻轻地把哈利放在门阶上，从斗篷里拿出一封信，塞进哈利的毯子里，然后回到另外两个人身边。他们三个人站在那里足足有一分钟，看着这个小包袱。海格的肩膀颤抖着，麦格教授愤怒地眨着眼睛，邓布利多眼睛里闪烁的光芒似乎消失了。 “Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.” “好吧，”邓布利多最后说，“就是这样。我们没理由呆在这里。我们不妨去参加庆祝活动。” “Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’ll be takin’ Sirius his bike back. G’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” “是的，”海格压低声音说，“我要把小天狼星的自行车还给他。”晚安，麦格教授——邓布利多教授，先生。 Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night. 海格用夹克袖子擦了擦眼泪，跳上摩托车，发动了引擎。随着一声轰鸣，它升到空中，消失在夜色中。 “I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply. “我想很快就会见到您了，麦格教授。”邓布利多向她点点头。麦格教授擤了擤鼻子作为回答。 Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four. 邓布利多转身沿着街道往回走。在拐角处，他停了下来，拿出了银推杆。他点了一下，12颗光球飞回了路灯旁，女贞路顿时变成了橘黄色，他能辨认出一只虎斑猫正在街的另一头转弯处鬼鬼祟祟地走着。他只看见四号台阶上的那捆毯子。 “Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. “祝你好运，哈利。”他转过身去，斗篷一响，他就不见了。 A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley⋯ He couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!” 微风吹皱了女贞路整洁的树篱。在漆黑的天空下，女贞路的树篱静悄悄的，整整齐齐的。哈利·波特在毯子里翻来覆去睡不着。只一个小信他,他睡在旁边,不知道他是特别的,不知道他是著名的,不知道他会在几个小时的叫醒时间德太太的尖叫,她打开前门把牛奶瓶,也不,他将在接下来的几周被刺激、捏着他的表妹达德利⋯他不知道此时此刻,全国各地的人们在秘密会议上保持自己的眼镜,压低了声音说:“致哈利·波特——活着的那个男孩!” J.K.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s StoneChapter One The Boy Who LivedMr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense. Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that. When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s drive. It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt — these people were obviously collecting for something⋯ yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery. He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying. “The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard—” “— yes, their son, Harry—” Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking⋯ no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn’t blame her — if he’d had a sister like that⋯ but all the same, those people in cloaks⋯ He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. “Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!” And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off. Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of imagination. As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw — and it didn’t improve his mood — was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. “Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: “And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?” “Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.” Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters⋯ Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er — Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister lately, have you?” As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister. “No,” she said sharply. “Why?” “Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. “Owls⋯ shooting stars⋯ and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today⋯” “So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley. “Well, I just thought⋯ maybe⋯ it was something to do with⋯ you know⋯ her crowd.” Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son — he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?” “I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. “What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?” “Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.” “Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. “Yes, I quite agree.” He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something. Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did⋯ if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t think he could bear it. The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind⋯ He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on — he yawned and turned over — it couldn’t affect them⋯ How very wrong he was. Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.” He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again — the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it. “Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.” He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled. “How did you know it was me?” she asked. “My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.” “You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said Professor McGonagall. “All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.” Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. “Oh yes, I’ve celebrating, all right,” she said impatiently. “You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no — even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I heard it. Flocks of owls⋯ shooting stars⋯ Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.” “You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. “We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.” “I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “But that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.” She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?” “It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?” “A what ?” “A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.” “No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn’t think this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone—” “My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this ‘You-Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.” Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ‘You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.” “I know you haven’t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.” “You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I will never have.” “Only because you’re too — well — noble to use them.” “It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.” Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said “The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what they’re saying? About why he’s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?” It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer. “What they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that they’re — dead.” Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped. “Lily and James⋯ I can’t believe it⋯ I didn’t want to believe it⋯ Oh, Albus⋯” Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. “I know⋯ I know⋯ ” he said heavily. Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on. “That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potter’s son, Harry. But he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why he’s gone.” Dumbledore nodded glumly. “It’s — it’s true ?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s done⋯ all the people he’s killed⋯ he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s just astounding⋯ of all the things to stop him⋯ but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?” “We can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “We may never know.” Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by the way?” “Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t suppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?” “I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the only family he has left now.” “You don’t mean - you can’t mean the people who live here ?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. “Dumbledore — you can’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t find two people who are less like us. And they’ve got this son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!” “It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly. “His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.” “A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. “Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know his name!” “Exactly.” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. “It would be enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even remember! Can you see how much better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take it?” Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it. “Hagrid’s bringing him.” “You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?” “I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore. “I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t pretend he’s not careless. He does tend to — what was that?” A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them. If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets. “Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?” “Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him, sir.” “No problems, were there?” “No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.” Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning. “Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall. “Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He’ll have that scar forever.” “Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?” “Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.” Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house. “Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog. “Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “You’ll wake the Muggles!” “S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. “But I c-c-can’t stand it — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles—” “Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out. “Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.” “Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’ll be takin’ Sirius his bike back. G’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night. “I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply. Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four. “Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley⋯ He couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!” J.K.
